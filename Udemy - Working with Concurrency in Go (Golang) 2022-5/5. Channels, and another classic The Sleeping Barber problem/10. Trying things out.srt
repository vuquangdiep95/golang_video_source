1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:07,340
So if everything went according to plan, I should be able to run this program now and see the expected

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,930
output.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,050
So let's give this a try.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,340
So I'll open my terminal and I'll make it a little bit bigger.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,060
Okay.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,110
And we'll type.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,170
Go run, dot, go, run, dot.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,940
Now, remember, we have one burger.

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:26,330
We have ten places in the waiting room, and people are arriving at a fairly steady clip.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,390
There's a lot of people arriving fairly quickly.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,890
So what should happen at the end of the day?

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,250
There should have been a lot of customers who left because they were waiting.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:34,970
Room was full.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,850
And are poor barbers going to have to stay way past closing time if everything went according to plan?

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,600
Let's find out.

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,200
Go.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,410
Run.

18
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,490
Don't return.

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,470
So lots of people came in and look at all the people being turned away.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,050
They leave because there's no room in the waiting room.

21
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,470
And here's our poor barber, Frank.

22
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,760
After the shop closes, he starts a client 11.

23
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,530
He goes through a whole bunch of different clients, finishing these poor people who are waiting in

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,100
the waiting room.

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,430
So I hope Frank was paid by the haircut and not by the hour.

26
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,600
Or maybe by both.

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,280
The poor guy had to stay really late.

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,360
So how do we make this a little more efficient so we don't have so many people leaving?

29
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,800
Of course that's not difficult.

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,350
Go to the top of Main Don.

31
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,770
Go.

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,770
And we can make the waiting room smaller.

33
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,450
So we could say seating capacity, too, with no other changes.

34
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,890
If I clear the screen and run this, we should still see lots of people leaving.

35
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,920
But Frank won't have to stay as long.

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,150
Let's find out if that works.

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,110
People are leaving.

38
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,190
Lots of people leaving, but at the end of the day, there should be far fewer people for Frank to do

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,490
after the shop closes.

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,970
And he only has to do one, two, three, one, two, 65, 76 and 84.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,500
So those are the ones that he finished.

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,830
Okay.

43
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,310
Now let's go back and change this to a seating capacity of ten again and let's add a few more barbers

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,780
and see if we can make this more efficient.

45
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,820
Clearly, this shop gets a lot of business.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
So let's add some barbers.

47
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,580
So I'll duplicate this.

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,640
Say, one, two, three, four, five.

49
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,890
So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six.

50
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
They can all be named Frank.

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,350
So we'll make this one.

52
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,290
Girard, Girard.

53
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,420
And we'll make this one, Milton.

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,360
And this one is Susan.

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,200
And this one is.

56
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,930
So, Kelly.

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,730
And finally, Pat.

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,760
Okay, so now we have far more barbers.

59
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,840
Let's see what happens this time.

60
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,860
Here, the screen.

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,280
We shouldn't see as many red lines because we have more resources available to take advantage of the

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
people in the waiting room.

63
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,800
Okay, here we go.

64
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,960
No red lines at all.

65
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,190
There's two red lines, three red lines for five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11.

66
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,890
Well, there's still some red lines there.

67
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,760
But it should finish a lot faster, too.

68
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,850
And everybody went home.

69
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,810
And the very last line says the barber shop is now closed for the day and everyone has gone home.

70
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,520
So as you can see, you can add barbers.

71
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,440
You can make the waiting room smaller or bigger.

72
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,940
You could change the arrival rate so people don't show up quite as quickly.

73
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,140
But clearly, we seem to have solved this.

74
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,940
But just to make sure and again, this is something you need to get the habit of doing go run dash race

75
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,950
dot to make sure there are no race conditions and there shouldn't be.

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,710
But let's make sure no warning and everything is going according to plan.

77
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,150
Okay.

78
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,440
Well, that was a lot of work.

79
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,860
But as you can see here, we have a really complex problem.

80
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,910
And all we used to solve it was the buffer channel.

81
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,910
The buffer channel, and that's pretty much it.

82
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,150
We have no new taxes and we have no wait groups and everything worked really, really quickly.

83
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,640
So this is a clear example of taking advantage of Go's philosophy.

84
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,680
Don't communicate by sharing memory.

85
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,720
Share memory by communicating.

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,180
Okay, let's move on to a slightly more realistic problem, one that you might run into in the real

87
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,510
world.

88
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,100
And we'll finish out the course with that.

89
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,900
See you in the next section.
