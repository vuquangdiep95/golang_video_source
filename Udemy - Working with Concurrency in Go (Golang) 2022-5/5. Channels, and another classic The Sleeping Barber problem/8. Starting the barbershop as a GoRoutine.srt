1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,490
So we're getting pretty close right now.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,550
We have successfully seeded a random number generator.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,740
We haven't used it yet, but we will very shortly.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,360
We've printed out a welcome message.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,110
We've created two channels that deal with the barbers, one for clients that the barber is waiting for,

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,120
and one when a barber is done for the day.

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,910
We created a type for barber shop and populated its various fields.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,090
We've printed out this message and we can add barbers, and the barbers successfully go and check to

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,770
see if there's a client in the waiting room.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,680
And if there's not, we know at least that they take a nap.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,650
Now, we need to do this part.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,820
Start the barber shop as a go routine.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,080
And this is good.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,560
Simple.

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,720
So what we're going to do, of course, you start a go routine, we'll just start start a routine with

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,610
a go funk like this.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,860
And of course, we have to determine what are we going to do in this barber shop go routine?

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,550
And really, what we need to do is we need to make sure that the go routine stays open, at least this

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,800
amount up here on line 36 time open, which in our case right now is 10 seconds.

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,610
Well, that's easy.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,410
We can do it like this.

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,240
And it's really simple for this part.

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,740
We simply do this time after and we look for time open.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,490
So what we're doing is waiting for that to happen.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,630
But we also, at this point, once the 10 seconds go by, we need to close the shop and we need at least

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,490
two channels to make that happen.

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,040
Okay.

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,770
So we're going to do fine tuning channels here.

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,290
We'll make a channel called Shop Closing, because remember, it's possible for people to show up before

30
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,400
the shop closes.

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,840
Find an available seat in the waiting room and wait in the rules.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,570
Say that the barber can't go as long as there's somebody still in the waiting room.

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,400
So we need this channel and we'll make that equal to.

34
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,550
I don't need parentheses here.

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,360
I need an assignment.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,810
Operator will make a channel of time book and then we'll have another one closed.

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,900
And that's a sign the value of again make channel book.

38
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,600
And what we'll do here is will block for the the length of time that this is supposed to be open.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:25,980
And then we'll send to the shop closing channel we'll send true and then finally we can say closed is

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,650
assigned or is pushed the value of true as well.

41
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,910
Now, in between those two, there's one more thing I want to do.

42
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,510
I want to take care of closing the shop for the day.

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,950
So what I will do is call a function that doesn't exist yet on the shop type.

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:49,290
That shop variable we defined right up on line 51 a call a function called close shop for day.

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,880
And it doesn't take any parameters.

46
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,030
Now, let's go write that over in Barber Shop Echo.

47
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,560
At the very bottom of the file, we'll create a function with the receiver of sharp pointer to Barbershop

48
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,230
and we'll call this close shop for day.

49
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,930
It doesn't take any parameters at all.

50
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,230
That's going to do is prints and messages out and things like that.

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,400
So we'll say color dot cyan just to make it stand out.

52
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,240
Closing shop for the day we print that message.

53
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,240
Okay.

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,760
And after that, we close the clients channel shopped up clients chain.

55
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,410
So we can't accept any more clients because that is now closed.

56
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,160
Okay.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,510
And here is where we set shop dot open equal to false.

58
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,120
So that field open on the type barbershop stored in the variable shop.

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,010
We're setting that defaults now.

60
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,220
And now the next thing we have to do is we have to wait until all the barbers are done.

61
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,840
And that's pretty easy, actually.

62
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,350
Okay.

63
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,570
Because when a Berber is done for the day, if you'll recall right here, we're sending the Sharpe Dot

64
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,430
Berbers done scanned the value of true.

65
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,820
So all we have to do, say four and I'll call this one a it's a sign the value of one.

66
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,870
It's a simple for loop.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,820
We're going to go through this.

68
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,710
A is less than or equal to.

69
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,280
Shop.

70
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,870
Number of barbers.

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,520
We know how many barbers we have and we increment one every time through the loop a plus plus.

72
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,990
And inside of this, we just call.

73
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,570
We wait for shop dot barbers dungeon to get something.

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,000
So that will block until every one of the barbers has sent the dumb value.

75
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,170
The value of true to the barbers done channel field of the type barber shop steward in the variable

76
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,190
shop.

77
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,970
Okay, so this will block until every single barber is done.

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,520
And once every single barber is done, what do we do?

79
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,380
We close.

80
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,100
The barber is done.

81
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,380
Chain, close, shop.

82
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,240
Got barbers done, champ.

83
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,070
We don't want to leave that open.

84
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,190
And now we can print out a message color dot green.

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:19,310
And I'll just say the barber shop is now closed for the day and everyone has gone home.

86
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,080
Then I'll duplicate that and I'll change this all to hyphens just so it's easy to see in the output.

87
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,770
Okay.

88
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,920
Just cosmetic.

89
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,890
Absolutely not important for concurrency.

90
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,680
There.

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,600
Okay.

92
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,380
So at this point, if we go back to Main, don't go.

93
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,050
Let's run it again.

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,030
Go!

95
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,840
Run, Dot.

96
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,060
I should wait for 5 seconds.

97
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,110
And everything looks exactly the same as it did before.

98
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,300
Now, that seems a little odd, doesn't it?

99
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:05,380
Because if you look at this go funk here on the line 69, we have this line time after time open.

100
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,800
Why did that not wait for 10 seconds?

101
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,490
Well, it's because we haven't actually sent any clients to this yet.

102
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,970
Okay.

103
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,730
We actually need to start sending some clients and then here block until the barber shop is closed.

104
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,940
So in the next lecture, we'll start adding clients.
