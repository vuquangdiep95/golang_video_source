1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:06,250
So in this final section of the course, we'll just write some tests for the code we wrote in the previous

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:06,920
sections.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,760
And testing is really important.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:14,200
And normally when I'm writing code for myself and not for a course, I write tests as I write code.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,330
But what we'll do in this section, we're not going to write tests for every single aspect of the code

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:19,810
we've written.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,490
Instead, we'll write a number of tests that are representative and that will give you enough tools

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,280
that you should be able to write your own tests as required.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,700
So to start with, we'll update our data, package those models to make sure that they're more testable,

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,460
because right now it's really difficult to test things with the way they're written.

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,780
And that's pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,560
We'll also test registering routes and we'll test rendering pages and we'll write tests for our handlers.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,150
And in particular, we'll write tests for the handler that uses concurrency the most.

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:49,930
All right.

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,490
Let's get started.
