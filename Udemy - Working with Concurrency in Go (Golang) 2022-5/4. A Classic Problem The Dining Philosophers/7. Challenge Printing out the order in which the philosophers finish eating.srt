1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,620
So this time around, I want to give you a bit of a challenge, and it's not difficult at all.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,500
And bear in mind that if this was a university classroom, I would give you just this right here.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,350
After we covered new taxes and wait groups, this is the information I would have given you with a bit

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,940
more detail, of course, but just asking you to complete the problem on your own and you would have

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,780
about a week to do it.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,850
But this is not a university classroom, so this challenge is considerably easier.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,370
What I want you to do is to keep track of when each of these philosophers is finished eating.

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,100
In other words, they've eaten three times.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,780
They've picked up the forks three times.

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,720
They've dropped three drop the first three times and they're done.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,070
And then down here at the very end, after you print out the message, the table is empty, you print

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,690
out the order in which people finished.

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,720
So that should be pretty straightforward.

14
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,040
You shouldn't have much difficulty with this at all.

15
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,160
Now, how you solve it is entirely up to you, but I'll show you how I solved it in the next lecture.
