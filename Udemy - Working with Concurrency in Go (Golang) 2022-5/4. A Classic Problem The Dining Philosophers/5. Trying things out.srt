1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,660
So let's try out our program and see if we got everything right.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,190
But before we do that, I did have a typo last time around and I think it was a copy and paste error

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,210
and I'm sure you noticed it.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,150
But here, when I unlock the new taxes in the dining problem function for some reason I have.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,680
I'm putting down the fork on his right twice.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,480
Of course, this should say left.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,860
Okay, so with that one change, let's open it up and see how it goes.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,180
So go.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,600
Run.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,120
Okay.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,040
So far so good.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:28,730
Oh.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,890
I see I have some print fs where I didn't put a carriage return in there, but that's not a big deal.

14
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,600
It's running anyway.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,820
So far so good.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,790
People are leaving the table.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,150
Okay.

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,060
The table is empty.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,960
Now, as you can see, I should have the carriage return after some print statement.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,040
So let's go fix that.

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:13,040
So print f there should be a slash in here, and I'll copy that and paste it after this print out.

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,390
And that was a print line.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,100
And after this print s, this print f and see if we have any more.

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,120
Looks like that's it.

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,000
So if I run this again now, it should format properly.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,450
Go.

27
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,050
Run, Dot.

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,200
That looks better now.

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,220
I can see what's going on.

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,030
So as you can see, as is to be expected, since this is running concurrently and using new taxes,

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,060
things don't occur in perfectly sequential order.

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,530
In some cases, we have people picking up a fork on one side and then having to wait for the other one

33
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,300
to be available.

34
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,910
But it is doing exactly what I expected it to do.

35
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,050
Perfect.

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,290
So let's complicate things a little bit in the next lecture.

37
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,420
And after that, I'll have a challenge for you.

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:03,840
Okay.

39
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,380
So nothing terribly difficult, but let's move on.
