00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,330
So in this section of the course, we're going to have a look at goal routines.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,950
And chances are, if you've been working with go for any length of time, you've probably used them

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,730
to some extent.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,620
But I'm going to go over the basics in any case and illustrate just how easy it is to use go routines

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,020
and why you have to be careful when you do it.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,090
So what are we going to do in this section?

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,990
Well, to start with, we're going to have a look at what a go routine is.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,580
And go routines are nothing more than a part of your program that runs.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,400
You might think of it as in the background or concurrently, and you can have multiple go routines running

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,340
at the same time and they're incredibly easy to use.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,420
You just have to type two characters in a space and suddenly you have a go routine.

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,180
But creating go routines, as we'll see in this section, it can create problems and there are multiple

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,950
ways with solving those problems.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,270
We can use new taxes, we can use weight groups, we can use channels.

15
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,800
We'll have a look at weight groups in this section because they're the easiest ones to understand,

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,960
I think, and they're really easy to implement.

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,300
But in any case, let's get started.
