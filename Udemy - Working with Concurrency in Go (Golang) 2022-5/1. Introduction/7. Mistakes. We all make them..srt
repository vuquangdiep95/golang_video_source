1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,140
I just want to take a few moments to talk about mistakes.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,320
Mistakes happen all the time in software development.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,880
And since this is an intermediate course, chances are you've made a few mistakes of your own.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,670
Well, one of the things I wanted to suggest is that during this course, I am going to make mistakes

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,750
and I'm not going to edit them out of the lectures.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,090
Everyone makes mistakes.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,510
And in fact, making mistakes is part of the software development process.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,290
Chances are, if you're a developer, you spend at least five or 6 hours every week, if not considerably

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,290
more, fixing your own mistakes or fixing someone else's.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,190
So as this course goes on, I will inevitably make mistakes.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,760
Some of them will be trivial and some will be somewhat less than trivial.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,120
But I'm not going to edit them out.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,310
Instead, I'll let you watch me identify and fix those problems.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,140
And that's just a little heads up.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,320
I always find it a little amusing to watch polished, heavily edited lectures where people appear to

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,080
be absolutely perfect in every way.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,710
And we're not.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,310
We're all human.

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,150
We make mistakes.

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:00,920
You do?

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,440
I do.

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,830
And you're going to get to see me make more than one, I'm sure.
