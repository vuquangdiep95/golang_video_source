1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:06,350
In this course I'll be using Make, which is a really good and very commonly used build tool.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,690
And of course, this is optional.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,930
If you don't want to do this, you can just run the software the way that you normally do.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:17,680
But I highly recommend you install Make and I'll be providing build scripts or make scripts, make recipes

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,140
as they're called as we go on in this course.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,870
So this is the documentation for make itself and I put a link to this in the course resources for this

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,420
and there's a couple of different ways to install it.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:34,660
But if you're in a mac far and away, the easiest is to use Homebrew and you install Homebrew by copying

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,910
this link, pasting it into a terminal window.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:43,150
And when you've done so, you can install make just by opening your favorite terminal and typing brew

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,510
install make and that will install it for you.

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,330
And when you're done you'll be able to run make right from the command line.

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,580
But if you're on windows, it's a little bit different.

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:58,000
And since most people these days are on Windows ten and some have made it to Windows 11, the equivalent

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,850
of home brew for Windows is called chocolatey.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,230
And you can install that.

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,540
And there's a link to this in the course resources right here.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,220
The instructions for doing so are pretty straightforward, and once you've done that, you'll open windows

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,710
and I'm on a mac, so I'm going to pretend I'm on windows right now.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:23,110
And you would type Choko install Mac and that will install a version of make that is suitable for this

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,560
course.

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,320
So go ahead and install Mac and let's move on.
