1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,710
So at some point during this course, you're probably going to want some help.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,720
You run into a problem you can't solve on your own and you need some assistance, and I'm happy to provide

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:09,930
that.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,230
But when you ask for help, there's a few steps you should take.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,330
Number one, search online.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,100
And chances are, you're going to do that by default.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,090
But just to be safe.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,710
Look online.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,460
If you've run into a problem, chances are somebody has run into that before.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,020
And a quick search on Google or your favorite search engine might give you the answer you're looking

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,320
for.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,710
The second thing you can do if that doesn't help is in every lecture you'll be able to download the

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,550
source code for that lecture as it exists at the end of that lecture.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,570
So you can always compare your code to mine and that might provide some assistance as well.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,660
If that doesn't help, check the Q&amp;A section.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,520
Somebody might have already asked a question very similar to yours, and the answer you're looking for

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,660
might be found there.

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,030
Finally, feel free to ask a question of your own in the Q&amp;A section, but if you do so, make sure

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,550
you give me some code to look at.

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,310
Ideally, give me a link to your git repository if you have one.

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,620
If not, please be sure to include enough code so that I can look at what you're doing and try to provide

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,700
some useful assistance.

23
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,430
Otherwise, I'm just guessing, and that's not terribly helpful.

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,240
All right.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,810
Let's move on.
