1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,970
So I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about myself, but I suspect it's important to at least

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,860
give some kind of introduction.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,460
I have been working in the software industry as an independent contractor for 25 years.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,220
I'll show a little bit more now, and I've also been teaching at the university level since 1991, which

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,320
means I do have a Ph.D. actually, I have a Ph.D. in English literature and computer science and in

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,890
education.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,120
But don't hold that against me.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,280
I teach at the university because I enjoy it, and it is certainly not my main source of income.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,250
I have won a bunch of awards regionally, nationally and internationally, including an Apple Award

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:38,880
at one point.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,670
And I've held contracts with KeyBank, with General Motors, with Hewlett Packard, with Sprint and

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,080
many, many others across Canada, the United States and Europe.

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,580
And well mean I could talk about myself endlessly, but at the end of the day, I've been working in

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,930
this field for a long time.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,050
I've been teaching for a long time and I really enjoy teaching.

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,550
So let's get to it.
