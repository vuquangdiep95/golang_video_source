00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,130
Chances are you already have go installed.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,800
But if not, let's install it and let's make sure we have the latest version.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,300
So to get go, we go to go door dev and there's a link to this in the course resources for this lecture.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,060
And we click this download button right here and that pops up a new window and you have your feature

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,660
downloads.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,730
If you're on Windows, you want this version.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,510
And at the time I record this go 1.18 is just out.

00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,970
If you're on Linux, you want this one, and if you're on one of the newer Macs, you're not going to

00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:43,060
want to get Darwin amd64, you're going to want to come down here and get Darwin Arm64 That's the one

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,650
you want if you have an apple chip.

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,930
So download that and install it and it's a very straightforward process and let's move on.
