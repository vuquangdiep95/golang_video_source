00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,230
Chances are you probably already have your favorite ID for working with go.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,860
But if not.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,310
Visual Studio code is free and it will do the job.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,310
Now there's a link to this page and of course resources for this lecture.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,340
Now, as you can see, you can download Visual Studio code for Windows, for Linux or for Mac.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,530
And again, pay attention on the Mac part.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,540
You can go universal, which will work for everything, or you can get one specifically for Intel Chip

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,550
or specifically for Apple silicon.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,300
So download that and once you've got it downloaded, start it up.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,070
And I already have it running here.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,180
There's a few extensions you're going to want to install and the first ones you're going to want are

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,150
the go ones.

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,300
So I want to bring up the command palette and I'm going to search for and you can see right here, I'm

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,360
searching for go colon space and then start typing install and you're going to want the install update

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,810
tools and then click on that and then click on the top checkbox which will check everything here and

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:02,440
click okay and you'll see it processing all of the various extensions and it's all done.

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,370
So that's ready to go.

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,320
And the other thing you're going to want to do is to go to the extensions button here on the left hand

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,740
side.

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,510
It's third from the bottom in my case.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,210
And I'm going to look for Go's template syntax, and that's my casual gym.

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,360
So search for go template syntax and click that.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,210
And I already have it installed, but you'll see an install button.

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,850
So install that and we'll be all set.

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,280
That should be everything we need to get started.
