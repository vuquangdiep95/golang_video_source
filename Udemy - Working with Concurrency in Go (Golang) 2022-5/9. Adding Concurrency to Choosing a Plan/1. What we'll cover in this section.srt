00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,790
In this section of the course.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,410
We'll continue with the code that we worked on in the last section, but we'll take care of the handlers

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,080
that actually allow a user to subscribe to a plan.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,410
And here's where we're going to add some actual concurrency, more sophisticated concurrency to our

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,070
code base.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,890
So what we're going to do, we're going to write a handler that fires off a couple of go routines.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,230
One will generate an invoice and we'll just write a simple stub handler that generates a dummy invoice

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,690
because that's not important for what we're doing in this course.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,210
But that will run in the background and we'll also have another go routine fired off that will open

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,360
a PDF file, say a user manual.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,070
We're going to assume that when you buy a plan from this service, you get a customized user manual

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,240
sent you as a PDF.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,230
So we'll open an existing PDF and we'll modify it, save that PDF and then send it off to the user as

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:52,950
an attachment.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,720
And these things will run concurrently.

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,870
And of course we will also subscribe a user to a plan.

17
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,610
So let's get started.
