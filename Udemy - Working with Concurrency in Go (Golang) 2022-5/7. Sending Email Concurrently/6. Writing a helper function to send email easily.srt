00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,970
So we think we have our code set up so that we can send email in the background.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,950
And of course the function that's called ultimately once we send something to a channel, this function

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,890
which is running in the background is a go routine listing for mail.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,630
Once it gets something on the app dock mailer, mailer, channel, channel, it fires off send mail

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,100
this function down here as its own go routine.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,940
And of course, that means any time I send something to this channel, I probably need to increment

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:37,900
this weight group, which is on the MAILER channel, and we get it from the application config.

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,790
We need to increment that by one.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,470
We need to add one to the weight group.

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,630
Otherwise, you know, bad things will happen.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,470
And of course, that's something that I personally will forget to do.

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,620
So to make life a little bit easier, let's write a little helper routine.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,880
So over here in the CMT Web folder, let's create a new file in there.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,380
I'll just call it Helper Echo and we'll just write a simple wrapper.

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,770
So this is in package main.

16
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,110
It will declare one function func with receiver of app pointer to config and we'll just call this,

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,070
send the email and it will take one parameter MSG of type message.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:15,650
Okay?

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,160
And it doesn't return anything.

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,130
And inside of here, here's where I'll increment my weight group so I know.

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,830
Don't forget to do it at dot wait dot add and we'll add one to it.

22
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,320
Okay?

23
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,740
And then we'll just take that message and send it to the appropriate channel.

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:38,620
So app dot mailer, dot mailer channel it, get sent MSG.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,220
And now I have a really easy way of sending email and I don't have to remember to increment the weight

26
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,000
group by one.

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,440
Okay, so a dead simple function and we'll use it in the next lecture.
