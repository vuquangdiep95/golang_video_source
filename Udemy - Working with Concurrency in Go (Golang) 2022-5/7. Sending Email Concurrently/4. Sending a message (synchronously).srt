1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,540
All right, let's give this a try.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,950
We have our mail all set up, and we think it works, but we need to verify that.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,010
And what we're going to do is send email synchronously.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,320
In other words, not in the background at once.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,200
We're sure that's where we'll send email using go routines.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:16,770
Okay.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,720
So to make this did simple.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:24,810
Let's go over to our roots file right here and let's create a test root and I'll put it right at the

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,350
end here.

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:25,860
Okay.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,740
So I'll say, Mark, start, get and I'll just call this test dash email and we'll inline a function.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:39,630
And of course, this has to be a handler, so we'll give it a response writer and a request.

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,090
And what we'll do is create a variable of the type mail.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:56,430
So we'll call this well, M is assigned the type of mail and we'll fill in its various fields.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,850
So we'll just hard code these just to get this testing out of the way domain we'll make that local host.

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,760
And our host is also local host because we're sending through mail hog which will have running in our

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,320
Docker images.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,830
Port Mail Hogs port is 1025.

19
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,640
Encryption will make that none because we're in development.

20
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:31,620
From name will make that equal to say info at my company dot com.

21
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,950
Actually, that would be from address credit again

22
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,150
and from name.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,180
We'll just make that info.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,120
And the Sync Group and the Ericsson and so forth where we are using --.

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,290
So let's make an --.

26
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,470
So since group we can leave empty dung.

27
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:04,500
Shan We can leave empty because we're not using those yet, but we'll actually make our error Chan equal

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,650
to make Chan there.

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,070
Okay, so now we have this variable and what I should be able to do to do now is to create a message.

30
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,700
So we'll take a message will be the variable name and it's a type message.

31
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,390
Okay?

32
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,850
And we'll fill in its various fields.

33
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,850
So we'll just put in the bare minimum to make this work.

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,150
Two is me at Care.com.

35
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,820
You got to send a message to someone.

36
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,320
Subject is, say, test email.

37
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,930
And then of course we need some data and we'll just make that hello world.

38
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,600
Okay.

39
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,550
Make that a colon like it's supposed to be and get rid of this.

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:53,990
That's better.

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,090
Now, let's try sending email m dot and we'll just call, send mail and give it MSG.

42
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,860
And give it an air chain.

43
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,580
So we'll make a chain of air.

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,450
Okay.

45
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,080
Now, when we hit this handler, assuming we have our Dr. Images running in the background, when I

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,860
go to slash test, dash email, I should get a blank screen.

47
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,430
But I should also get an email sent if everything went according to plan.

48
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,270
Let's find out.

49
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,260
So I'll open my terminal and I'll clear this and make start.

50
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,440
And it was already listening on that.

51
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,020
So make restart.

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,770
Okay, so it's running.

53
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,980
So let's go to our web browser.

54
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,090
And first of all, I'll just reload this page to make sure it works.

55
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,780
It does.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,360
And now I'll click test.

57
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,260
Dash mail was a test stash mail.

58
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,370
I'm going to verify that.

59
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,110
Test.

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,410
Dash.

61
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:56,830
Email.

62
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:58,660
Test.

63
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,530
Dash email.

64
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,380
So we've got a blank screen.

65
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,360
Now, if I go to local host port 1825.

66
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,770
There is my test email, so there is one formatted as HTML and there's one formatted as text.

67
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,440
So now we know email actually works.

68
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,290
So the next step is to actually send email using go routines in the background, and we'll get started

69
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,850
on that in the next lecture.
