1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,860
So I'm back in the Mingo file and I'm looking at the function shut down near the bottom of the file.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,280
Of course, this is the one that is called by listen for shutdown.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:10,830
Okay.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,470
And here's what we need to do.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,470
A little bit of cleanup.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,000
So what kinds of things do we need to do to start with?

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,520
And this is you know, you really just being a purist and make sure that things work the way that they

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:22,970
should.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,120
We have that channel dungeon on the mailer, which is in our app config.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,720
So I'm going to send that a true just to tell that go to quit.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,680
So app dot mailer got done can that get sent through.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,430
Okay.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,520
So that's the first thing I'm going to do is quit that routine.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,150
Okay.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,390
Now, think this through is not the right place to put this.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,130
Ask yourself that question.

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,170
Should I quit that go routine that's listening for mail by sending true to the dungeon?

18
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,800
Should I do it here or should I do it later on?

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,510
Well, if you think it through, I'm blocking until the weight group is empty.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,400
I probably should take this.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,420
Not here.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,980
It doesn't belong there.

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,750
That should happen after I'm finished sending any email.

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,230
Okay.

25
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,730
So we send that true.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,160
And then we just close our channels and I'll put that after the comment that says I'm closing the channels

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,790
right here.

28
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,650
Now, how do you close channels?

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,910
Well, we close apt mailer dot mailer channel.

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:36,500
We close at dot mailer dot error channel and we close app, dot mailer, dot dungeon.

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,580
And those are now all closed.

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,880
Okay, so now I think we're ready to give this a try.

33
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,590
So what I'm going to do is open my terminal and I'll type make restart in case it's running.

34
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,610
And it wasn't, but it's starting up now and I have my Docker images running in the background, so

35
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,840
I'll go to my web browser and I'll reload this page to make sure it's working.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,350
It is.

37
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,400
And I'll try logging in and I'll try logging in with the wrong information.

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,900
You'll notice I have mail hog running in a separate tab over here, and it's currently empty.

39
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,220
There's nothing in the inbox.

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,400
So let's log in with the valid email address admin app example dot com.

41
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,930
That'll put in the wrong password.

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,550
I'll just type the word wrong and I have invalid credentials.

43
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:30,470
Now if I go over to Mail Hog, I have my email failed login attempt and there it is, all nicely formatted

44
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,310
as HTML.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,920
Well, it's not that formatted, but it could be how I wanted it to be.

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,350
And I also have it as plain text.

47
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,680
So that works exactly as it should.

48
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,040
Okay, let's move on to the next section and before we can do some of the other tasks that we have commented

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,990
there in the handlers dog go file, we actually need to implement the logic that allows the user to

50
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,340
register and to subscribe to one of the three services we're offering.

51
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,260
Okay, so we'll get that out of the way in the next lecture and then we'll move on to more concurrent

52
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,710
logic.
