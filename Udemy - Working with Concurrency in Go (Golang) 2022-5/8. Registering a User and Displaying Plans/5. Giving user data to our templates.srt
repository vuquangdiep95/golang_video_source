1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,020
So now that we can actually register user, activate that user and that sort of thing, the next step

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,780
is to allow that user to select one of the three plans that we're offering in our fictitious website,

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,780
our fictitious company, the Bronze, Silver or Gold Plan.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,670
But if you recall some time ago when we were working on this function, add default data in the rendered

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,180
go file, I left this comment to do get more user information.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,560
And what I want to do is once that user is authenticated, we've actually put their user information

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,700
in the session and we want to get it out.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,490
Now I want to make that available to the template, but only if the user is authenticated.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,430
And fortunately, that's pretty easy.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,060
So I'll delete this comment and I'll put a simple check in here.

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,120
So I'll look for the user variable to be populated and I'll also put an okay there, which will be true

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:02,460
if I can get this and false if I can't and I'll call apt session knocked out load i want does it get

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,230
from the context for using the context I'm looking for user.

14
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,950
Okay.

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,970
And I'm going to get that and then I'm going to cast it to a data dot user type.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:15,840
Okay.

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,960
So that's what I'm calling now.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,010
This will be false if I can't get that information and this will be true if I can.

19
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,800
And remember, I'm casting it to a data dot user, not a pointer to a data dot user.

20
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,250
Okay.

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,420
So we'll say if not, okay and I'll just write to the info logger there, log after error log dot print

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,940
line and I'll just put can't get the user from session.

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,860
And that's purely from my my information.

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,690
Nobody's ever going to see that on the website.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,470
Otherwise I want to add the user to all the information that's available to me in the template.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,100
Okay.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,880
So let's scroll up to the top and uncomment this line where I'm adding the user to the all the data

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,250
that's going to every single template.

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,660
And I'll say this to format it.

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:14,010
And now I'll go back down to where I'm putting this in here and I'll say TV user is equal to and it

31
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,210
has to be a pointer, right?

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,050
I can't just put the user in there as an object.

33
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,010
It needs to be a pointer.

34
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:27,600
So I'll put a reference to user and that will give me access to everything stored in that user data

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,470
type on every single page that an authenticated user visits.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,890
Okay, so let's move on and get started displaying the plans that our users can subscribe to once they're

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,390
registered for our site.
