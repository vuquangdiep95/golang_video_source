1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:06,180
So in this section of the course, we're focusing upon adding and activating users and displaying the

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,820
list of available subscriptions to our users.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,740
Now, although this course is entitled Working with concurrency and go, there's not going to be a lot

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,530
of concurrency in this section, but we need to get this out of the way.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,300
So we get to the point where we can actually write some code where concurrency is appropriate.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,770
So what are we going to do?

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,910
To start with, we're going to worry about adding users to the system and validating user accounts.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,440
And the way we'll do that is when a user registers, we'll send them an email with a link in it that

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,020
they have to click on in order to activate their account.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,710
And of course, for security purposes, that URL, the one that's included in the email, it needs to

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,350
be signed so that it can't be tampered with.

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,340
And we'll take care of that.

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,510
And it's really straightforward.

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,820
And the last thing we'll do in this section is just modify your application so that there's a page that

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,930
displays all of the available subscriptions, things that users can buy.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,040
So let's get started.
