1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:01,630
All right.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,300
So we've managed to register a user and make them inactive and send that activation email.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,580
And of course, now we want to write the handler and set up a route that allows them to click on the

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,760
link in their email and validate their account and set them to active.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,520
And of course, the handler is the stub handler activate account in the file handler scope.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,320
So the first thing we're going to do and remember this is going to come in as a get request.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,420
It's not a form post, they're just clicking a link.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,020
And the first thing I want to do is to validate the URL.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:39,850
Okay, so I validate the URL by first of all, getting this part of the request or I'll call it URL.

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,230
URL is assigned the value of from the request.

11
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,600
Get the request you are okay.

12
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:54,580
And then I want to build a test string, something I can use to actually validate the url.

13
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,960
So I'll say test url.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:03,520
It's a sign the value of from the format package s print f and I'll give it a s print f and I'll give

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,630
it a format string.

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:10,150
So again, I'm hardcoded in the URL, but normally you'd get that from the environment or a dot on file

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,990
or something like that.

18
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:19,660
So I'll put an HDP code slash slash local host like that and then a percent s with nothing between local

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:26,440
host and the percent s and I'll substitute URL what I just grabbed from the request that gives me the

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,250
test url.

21
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,450
Okay.

22
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,600
And I'll declare a variable.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,320
Okay.

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,700
And that is assigned a value when I call verify token and I hand that test the URL.

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,570
So that will be the URL with the hash appended to it.

26
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:43,920
Okay.

27
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,270
So that's what we're passing to verify token.

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:55,450
And if I get OC back as true, this is a valid token, but if I get not OC other words OC is false,

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,950
then we have an invalid URL signature, so we'll just throw an error at them.

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:09,040
So we'll set in the session after session, dot put and I'll put using icon text and I'll put an error

31
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,610
and I'll just put invalid token which is sufficient for our purposes.

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:23,380
You can put whatever you want in there naturally and do a redirect, exploit redirect using W and R

33
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,340
and we'll take them say just to the homepage, try that again, just to the home page with an error

34
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,540
dot status, the other or whatever status you want to use.

35
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,350
Then we return.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,700
No point in going any further.

37
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,240
Okay.

38
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,560
So now I'm going to ignore these comments because they're probably going to go somewhere else.

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,260
My next step is to activate the account.

40
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,900
And how do I do that?

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,760
Well, I get the user from the database.

42
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,370
I set active to one and I save the user.

43
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,800
I know how to get the user because I have their email address.

44
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:03,340
So I'll say you an error come from and I'm going to call app dot models dot user doesn't get my email

45
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:10,540
and I can get the email right from the query parameters are the URL query that again

46
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,720
not get and I'm looking for email.

47
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,580
Okay and I'll check for an error.

48
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,600
So I'll copy this.

49
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,670
This right here.

50
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,430
And do would check for an error if error is not equal to nil.

51
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,710
And I'll just paste that in and change this.

52
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,840
No user found

53
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:46,540
otherwise activate the account account you don't active user I just got from the database that's equal

54
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,860
to one and I update the user and that's easy and is equal to.

55
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,980
You don't update.

56
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,970
And all the information stored in the receiver for that method.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,710
So all I have to do now is check for an error.

58
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,350
So I'll copy this and paste this here and say.

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,020
Unable to update user.

60
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,130
But if I get past that, I'm just going to redirect.

61
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,810
So I'll copy these two lines to save some typing.

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,280
Put it in here and get this back where it belongs.

63
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,620
And I'll make this a flash message.

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
And I'll change this to.

65
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,490
Account activated,

66
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,530
you can now log in and will take them to the log in page.

67
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

68
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,400
Now, I'm going to leave these comments from here here for right now, but will be moving them to handlers,

69
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,280
to the appropriate handlers when we make those handlers in a bit.

70
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,130
And the last step is to go over to roots and set up the appropriate route.

71
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,490
So we'll open route, stock up.

72
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,200
And we'll change this just to activate.

73
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:55,860
Okay.

74
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,240
And that goes to activate account because that's what's in the email and that's the easiest step.

75
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,220
So now I should be able to make restart.

76
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,200
Go back to my web browser.

77
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,500
I still have this account activation email open.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
I'll just click on activate your account and see what happens.

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,080
The account is activated you can now log in and I think I used me and here dot com with password test.

80
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,460
Let's see if that works.

81
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,090
Everything worked according to plan.

82
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,020
Perfect.

83
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,430
So the next step is to create another menu item or a button here or something that allows and authenticated

84
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,830
user to subscribe to an account.

85
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,740
And of course, that'll require a couple of more handlers and it'll allow us to write some concurrent

86
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,340
code as well over here.

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,530
So these comments that show up back in handlers not go, these are going to get moved into the appropriate

88
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,700
handlers and we'll write all of these or as much of that as we can concurrently.

89
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,010
Okay, so let's move on.
