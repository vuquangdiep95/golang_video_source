1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:01,780
All right.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,620
We're almost ready to try things out.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,820
But I did have a couple of typos in the last lecture.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:14,470
The first one is down here in the comment that I part of the then clause in our sworn call.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,140
And then it's just the missing equals sign right here.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,420
Otherwise, we're not going to be able to get that query parameter and up here in the range statement.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,270
For some reason I said range through index dot data plan, but it's actually plans plural.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:34,960
As you can see over here in the handler, we added plans as the key on line 178 micro.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,530
Okay.

10
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,440
So now we need to add a route to this handler.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,860
So let's go back to our routes file right here and let's add a route right here.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,180
I'll put it like this.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,780
Mac, start.

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,040
Get that again.

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:49,840
Mac start.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,540
Get slash plans and that's going to go to app dot choose subscription.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,880
Okay, so let's restart our application or start it in my case, make start, my Docker images are running

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,880
so we have access to the database and it started.

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,560
Now go to my web browser and go to local host.

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,390
Okay.

21
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,040
So the pages are working now.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,010
We don't have a link to it yet, so let's just put Slash plans here.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,020
And I'm logged in and I can see it now.

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,030
I'll copy this.

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,100
First of all, let's try the button.

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,810
Make sure this fire is as expected.

27
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,810
I'm going to choose the bronze plan and it gives me my nice little dialogue and I cancel and it takes

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,740
me back to this page.

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,690
Now let's log out.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,730
And try going to local host slash plants and I should get a warning and get redirected.

31
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,500
And I do.

32
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,160
Okay.

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,270
So that all works really well.

34
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,160
Now, let's add a link up here.

35
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,530
First of all, let me log in and then at example dot com with the password.

36
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,400
Very secret.

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,370
So I've loved it.

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,460
Now I want a plans thing to show up here.

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,930
Now, obviously, in a real Web site, you're going to have one that's available to the public.

40
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,160
But we just want to get to the part where we can write some concurrent logic.

41
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,040
So let's go back over to our I.D. and let's open up and have Bardot partial don't go each HTML.

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,590
And that's the navigation bar at the top of the screen.

43
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,810
And all I have to do is to duplicate this line and change it to plans and plans.

44
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,500
And I will only show up for authenticated users.

45
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,910
So let's go back over here now and reload this page.

46
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,440
And there's my plans link.

47
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,480
And it works as expected.

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,890
Okay.

49
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:45,760
Now, when I'm logged in and after I've bought a plan, I shouldn't see select next to the plan that

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,900
I'm currently looking at.

51
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,750
It should say something like currently select it.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,780
Let's put that logic in place because that's pretty easy.

53
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,600
Remember, we added all of the user information to every rendered template.

54
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,100
So back here in the plans dot page, don't go each time out.

55
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,670
Let's go to the content block.

56
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,930
Define content.

57
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,930
And right after the opening line for that block, I'll create a variable called user and that will be

58
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,060
assigned the value of DOT user.

59
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,580
The only reason I'm doing that is it gives me easier access to it inside this range statement and this

60
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,870
is where I need to do things.

61
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:29,750
So really the only place I'm making a decision about whether or not a user has a plan is in this.

62
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,170
This block right here where I'm displaying the button.

63
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,930
So what I can do is put an if statement here.

64
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,890
So if I want to put the end condition, if two things are true.

65
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,080
And the first one is that the user has a plan because a user might not have a plan if they just register,

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,920
they certainly don't.

67
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,940
So dollar sign user.

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:04:01,650
So if that's true and we have an equality check here, user dot plan dot ID is equal to ID.

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,170
If that's true, then I'm going to display something.

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,740
Okay.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,930
And then I'll put an else here.

72
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,590
And close my if statement.

73
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:21,480
And and what I'm going to put in this first block, this first check, get over to the right spot.

74
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,720
The simply strong.

75
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,520
Current plan.

76
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,310
Strong.

77
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,810
Okay.

78
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,580
So we'll save that.

79
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,860
And then I'm going to go to Beekeeper Studio and give my user a plan.

80
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,800
So I start a beekeeper studio and I'll manually add an entry.

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,830
So I'll go to concurrency and connect.

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,980
And I look at my users to see what my ideas.

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,970
So I'd one for immediate example dot com and I'll go to user plans.

84
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,570
And I'll add a row, so I'll outro.

85
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,980
Let the IDB generate generated.

86
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,420
One is my user ID.

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,880
I'll subscribe to plan one.

88
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,180
I'll just put a date in here.

89
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:18,220
2022 zero 517 2022 zero 517 and I'll apply this.

90
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:19,870
Okay.

91
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,080
Now that user is now subscribed with the plan.

92
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,860
But if I go back to my website and I reload this page.

93
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,560
We have an error, so there's a typo in there somewhere.

94
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,040
Neil Poynter Evaluating Direct planned ID.

95
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,920
Okay, so got a mistake there somewhere.

96
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,520
Let's go find that back over to my I.D. dot plan.

97
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,470
That's better.

98
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,100
Okay.

99
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,900
So the user was set, but plan was set to nil.

100
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,800
So I'm checking to see if plan is actually not nil.

101
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,070
In other words, that pointer points to some location in memory that has data.

102
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,340
So let's go reload that page and see if that works again.

103
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,050
Reload.

104
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,770
Okay.

105
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,160
Even though it reloaded the page successfully, it still doesn't show that I'm subscribed to the bronze

106
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,520
plan.

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,410
And that's because the user data that I'm getting for this page comes from the session.

108
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,590
And when I logged in, I didn't have that plan.

109
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:26,510
But if I'm longer and long back in admin example dot com very secret this time it should work.

110
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,370
And now I want to go to plans.

111
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,100
It shows me that's my current plan.

112
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,700
Perfect.

113
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:40,530
Okay, let's move on and we'll write a stub handler for choosing and subscribing to a plan and we'll

114
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,780
get started on that in the next lecture.
