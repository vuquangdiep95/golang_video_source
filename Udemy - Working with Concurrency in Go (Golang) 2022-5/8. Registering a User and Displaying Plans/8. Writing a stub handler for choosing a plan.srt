1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,540
So the next step in this process is to get started on the route in the handler that allows us to subscribe

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,320
to a plan.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:15,520
So over here in plans, dot page go HTML, the URL we're going to is slash subscribe.

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,960
So let's uncomment this now because we'll have it active in a few minutes and let's go back over to

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,080
Rootstock, go and set up a handler for subscribe.

6
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:32,440
So we'll set up a muscat and it's going to go to slash subscribe and it's going to go to a handler that

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,750
doesn't exist yet called say subscribe to plan.

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,950
Okay, now let's go over to our handlers and create a stub handler for that.

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,400
So right after I'll put a right before this one because I want to be using some of these comments funk

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:56,650
app pointer to config and we'll call this subscribe to plan and it takes a response writer and a pointer

11
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,430
to a request.

12
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:01,660
Okay.

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,260
Now let's put some comments in here just so we have something to work with.

14
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,930
So what do we want to do in here?

15
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:16,210
Well, first of all, we want to say get the idea of the plan that is chosen and that comes as a query

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,620
parameter named on DH.

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,760
That'll be easier.

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,900
And the next thing we want to do is to get the plan from the database.

19
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,560
We need to know some information about it.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,050
Okay.

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,490
And then we're willing and we want to get the user from the session.

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,780
So this means that I now know the user.

23
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,340
I know the I know the plan the user has chosen.

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,310
And of course, there's a few things I need to do here.

25
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,500
Number one is generate an invoice.

26
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,310
So let's get that comment at here and put that down here.

27
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,180
Okay.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,970
So we're going to want to generate an invoice.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,850
Then we're going to want to send an email with the invoice attached.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,550
So let's put that comment down here.

31
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,050
Then we're going to want to say generate a manual.

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,230
So I'm going to assume that when you buy a gold plan, you get a manual that's customized for you as

33
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,640
a PDF and that sent to you.

34
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:16,020
So we'll say generate a manual and will generate a very simple one because it's not critical to have

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,530
an actual fully formatted manual for a non-existent service.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,400
We just want to generate a PDF with some custom information in it and send that.

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,020
Then we want to send an email

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,240
with the manual attached.

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,310
Okay.

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,050
And after that, we're going to want to subscribe.

41
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,070
These are to an account.

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,950
Let's put this over where it belongs.

43
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,860
And then finally, we're going to want to redirect.

44
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:50,890
Okay.

45
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:57,400
So that's at a high level the sorts of things we want to do in this subscribe to plan handler.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,590
So obviously, some of this can be done in real time or sequentially.

47
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,410
So getting the ID, getting the plan, getting the user.

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,030
But this stuff generating an invoice, sending an email, generate a manual, sending an email.

49
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,060
All of that should take place in the background or concurrently, and that's what we're going to work

50
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,750
on next.

51
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,880
So this is enough to get us started.

52
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,170
Let's move on.
