00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,260
So before we can work with the database, we probably should add some tables and at least one user because

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,910
we need someone to log in with.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,820
And if you go to the course resources for this lecture, you'll see a file you can download called DB

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,600
Dot SQL.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,260
Does it download that file, unzip it and open it up in your favorite text editor I have right here,

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,040
select all and copy and this is just basic sequel to create some tables and populates a couple of them.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,550
So copy that and go over to Beekeeper Studio, which I have running and I'll connect to my database

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,810
concurrency and I'm going to paste what I just copied here in the query window, which shows up by default.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,680
Then I'll say select all and run the selection.

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,050
And that, as you can see, creates a table called plans.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,650
And if you look inside of that, we have three plans.

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,490
These are the various things that people can subscribe to.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,530
So we have a bronze plan.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,090
The plan amount is the price of the plan in sense.

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,460
Whenever I'm working with currency, I tend to store the information in the database as a whole, number

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,350
as an integer, and then I just divide by 100 to get the actual dollars and cents value.

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,060
So we have bronze, silver and gold, which cost ten, 20 and $30 respectively.

18
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:26,070
We have a users table and that has one user and the username is the email admin at example icon.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,120
The first name is admin, the last name is user.

20
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,870
The password is actually a hash of a password and the password for this user is very secret, all one

21
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,700
word and all lowercase.

22
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,170
And if we scroll over here a bit, we have a user active field.

23
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,360
One means the user is active, zero means the user is not is in an is underscore.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,840
Admin tells me whether or not this user is an administrator and then created out and updated out and

25
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,400
the actual user plans is just a joined table.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,410
It only has a few columns, so it has the ID column, which is the primary key.

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,970
Then we have the user ID, which is a foreign key to the user's table and the plan ID, which is a foreign

28
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,140
key to the plans table.

29
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,130
So if user one buys the bronze plan, this would be whatever the primary key is, one would be the user

30
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,950
ID column, one would be the plan ID column and created out and updated are just timestamps.

31
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,600
Okay, so we have some content in our database.

32
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,640
In the next lecture will install the data package.

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

34
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,880
That'll be the necessary SQL commands and the models that allow us to interact with the database.

35
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,900
Let's move on.
