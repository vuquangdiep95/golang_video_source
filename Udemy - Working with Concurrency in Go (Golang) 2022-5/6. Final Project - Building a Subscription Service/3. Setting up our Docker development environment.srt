1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,460
So in this project, we're going to be using Postgres as a database.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,570
We're going to be using Redis as a store for our session information.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,280
And we're also going to require some kind of mail server, a dummy mail server that will capture mail

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,730
for us.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,480
And I want to use Docker for that and I really encourage you to do so as well.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,410
I've had a number of people say to me, Don't Docker, slow my system down.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,380
It never has.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,060
As I said a couple of times, I'm running this on a seven year old Mac and Docker works just fine.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,190
So I encourage you to do that.

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,370
Now.

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,610
If you want to install Redis locally and you want to install Postgres locally and so on and so forth,

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,700
you feel free to do so.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,750
But I really encourage you to give Docker a try.

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,430
It works really well and it is not that resource intensive.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,620
So to make that happen, what I'm going to do is have you go to the course resources for this lecture

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,270
and you see a file there called Docker Dash, composed with a small dot zip.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,620
Download that file, unzip it and put it as I have at the root level of my project.

18
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:08,500
So right beside the cmd folder, right beside go to AdMob, go to mod, there's my file, docker compose,

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,820
let's give it a look.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,690
And then just in case you don't have Docker installed, I'll show you where to go and get that.

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:21,430
So this is a very simple Docker compose and what this allows me to do is to start what you see here,

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,380
three services Postgres.

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:29,680
So Postgres 14.2 is the version I'm going to use for this course Redis And I'm just using the latest

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,400
version of Redis.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,620
It doesn't really matter, but the latest one will do the trick.

26
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:38,200
And then Mail Hog, which is an unfortunate name, but this is a dummy mail server and it allows us

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,350
to send the email without actually sending email mail home, captures it, and it offers a web interface

28
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,970
where we can go and look at our email.

29
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,860
So we'll start this in a minute.

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,410
But if you don't have Docker installed, also one of the course resources for this lecture, you'll

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,960
see a link to this Web page right here.

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,680
And these are the instructions for a mac.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,480
But as you can see on the left hand side, there's instructions for windows and there's also instructions

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,660
for Linux.

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,090
Okay.

36
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,010
So so it doesn't matter what operating system you're on.

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,720
The instructions are pretty simple.

38
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,320
Now, just a word of caution about the version for Mac.

39
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,240
If you're on an older Mac, like like I am with an intel chip, this is the one you want.

40
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,870
If you're on a mac with one of Apple's own chips, the M1 or the M1, ultra or one of those, then you

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,530
want this one.

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,580
Make sure you get the right one.

43
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,970
So install that.

44
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,190
So once you have that installed, let's go back to our I.D. and I'll bring it up.

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:41,590
Now, as you can see here on line 16 of my doctor compose y email, I'm saying have a volume stored

46
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,080
the data for Postgres in the current directory.

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,400
That's what the dot means then.

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,820
Then in a folder called DB Data, they're in a folder called Postgres.

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,190
Now, in a lot of cases, Docker will create that for you.

50
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,860
But I'm not an optimist, so I'm going to create a new folder at the root level of my project called

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,530
DV Dash Data, and inside of that I will create two folders.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,640
The first one is for Postgres and it's just called Postgres.

53
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,110
And the second one is a new folder for Redis.

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,790
Okay.

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,970
Now, once I've done that, I can open my terminal and clear my screen and type docker dash, compose

56
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,470
up, dash de.

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,330
Okay, now the dash de will run this in the background and I'm going to do that.

58
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,800
So here, return.

59
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,640
And what'll happen is it creates and starts all of these.

60
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,260
Now they're starting right now and you can see it created all of these files for Postgres and there's

61
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,790
probably some for Redis as well.

62
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,310
Not yet, but it'll get there eventually.

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:39,700
Okay.

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,970
So I'm going to hide that and I'm going to go to on a mac.

65
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,070
I just go to the little Docker icon like this on Windows.

66
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,470
It's in your system tray and I'll bring up the dashboard.

67
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,960
And I click on containers and then I expand this final project and I'll click on, say, the Postgres.

68
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,870
And it takes a while the very first time it starts it because it has to initialize the database.

69
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,510
And what it's doing is not just initializing an empty database store and it seems to be finished here.

70
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:18,440
Back over in my Docker compose, it's actually creating a database called concurrency and you access

71
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,460
it using this username Postgres and this password, which is just password.

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:22,940
Okay.

73
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,340
So that creates all of that for us.

74
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,500
Now once that's up and running, you're going to want to get your favorite database client as well.

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,490
And I recommend you use this one and I'll put a link through this in the course resources as well.

76
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,580
It's called Beekeeper Studio, and there are versions for Mac and there are versions for Windows.

77
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,720
You can just click on the download button up here and it will take you to the one appropriate for your

78
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
operating system.

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,050
And as you can see, it supports Windows, Mac and Linux.

80
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,970
So if you don't have a Postgres client and this is one means of just connecting to the database and

81
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,950
looking at it so we don't have to use the command line.

82
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,210
And it's really easy to use and it's free and I think there's some paid version of it.

83
00:04:59,210 --> 00:04:59,510
I'm not.

84
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,710
Yeah, the ultimate edition.

85
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,000
But you want the community edition right here because it's free and it will do the trick for us.

86
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,510
So get Docker installed, bring up Docker, compose, let it run for a while to make sure the database

87
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,060
is initialized and download Beekeeper studio if you need a client.

88
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,990
Okay, let's move on.
