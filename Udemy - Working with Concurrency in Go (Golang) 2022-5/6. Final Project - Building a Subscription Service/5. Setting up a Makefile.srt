00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,550
So this time around, we want to set up a make file just to make our lives a little bit easier.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,540
And the process is a little bit different in on Windows than it is on Mac.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,650
But to speed things along, if you go to the course resources for this lecture, you'll see two files.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,430
One is called Makefile dot zip, and that's for Mac or Linux, and the other one is called Makefile,

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,900
dot windows, dot zip.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,550
And obviously that's for windows.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,550
So download the one appropriate for your operating system, unzip it and put it at the root level of

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,860
your project and make sure it's called Makefile with a capital M and no extension.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,310
Okay.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,290
And before we actually look at that, I did have a couple of typos in the last lecture.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,270
And you think I would have noticed that because, you know, the whole bright red color in the mango

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,050
file name here.

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,130
But apparently I wasn't that alert last time around and they're easy fixes.

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:58,020
The first one is here in mango in line for the line 34 function called in DB in my code I didn't return

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,470
anything.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,380
And of course I just have to go return corn.

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,340
Okay.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,940
And the second one is down here in this for loop.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,660
Even though I have the variable counts, I never actually incremented count.

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,000
So I need to do that counts plus plus.

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,250
And I fixed both of those typos before I uploaded the source code for the last lecture.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,730
Okay.

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,380
So in any case, now let's have a look at the Makefile and I'll go to the Mac version first Mac and

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,090
Linux and then I'll go through the windows.

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,510
So it's a really simple file at the very top.

26
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,040
I have three variables and these are substituted down here.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,420
So for example, I have binary underscore name is equal to my app and down here each of these is a command

28
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,940
I can type after I type the keyword make.

29
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,290
So if I type make build of the command line in the same directory where this Makefile exists, it will

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,190
build the binary.

31
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,850
So here it runs the on c c go enabled is set the zero which is good good practice for building a binary.

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,540
If you're not using zygote now then I just build it and you can see that binary name in curly brackets

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,960
with a dollar sign in front of it that's substituted for.

34
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,930
Or we get a substitution there for my app.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,940
Okay, so we can build it, we can run it, we can clean it, which is clean the binary and runs go

36
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,450
clean.

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,880
Start is just an alias for run stop stops everything and restart first run stop then run start and we

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,140
have test for running tests.

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,100
We'll get to that eventually.

40
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,300
Okay.

41
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,870
Now, one key thing you have to know about make files is here.

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,070
That has to be a tab.

43
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,680
You can't use spaces, it has to be a tab.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,320
So if for some reason when you download this, those are converted to spaces which apparently has happened

45
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,310
at some point in the past.

46
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,010
I don't know why.

47
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,370
Just change them all to tabs and you'll be fine.

48
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,580
Okay, so that's the version for Mac and Linux.

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,220
Now the Windows version right here, unfortunately, you're not going to see any any coloration here

50
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,160
because Windows doesn't mean anything to my idea.

51
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,380
But the process is almost the same.

52
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,060
Just some of the commands are different.

53
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,910
So like line 12, for example, a little bit different.

54
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,200
So we have, as you can see here and DSN, that's our data source name, that's for connecting to Postgres

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,090
and that's the one we care about right now.

56
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,750
And I exist so obviously over the other other one as well.

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,840
And in this case for Windows, I just put a dot xy at the name of the binary name so Windows will know

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,770
it's an executable.

59
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:33,270
Okay, so I have the appropriate file name to make file and I'm in the final project folder right at

60
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,930
the root level.

61
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,570
So I'm in the correct directory.

62
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,600
And if I type else, you can see that the make file is right there.

63
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,910
And if I type make start, this should run my application and connect to the database.

64
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,010
If we get everything right, let's find out.

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,350
It's building it.

66
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,000
It connected to the database.

67
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,820
Life is good and at this point it's actually terminated in finished because it is not doing anything

68
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,150
else.

69
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:06,790
If you look in the main ego file over here, all we're doing is connecting to the database, pinging

70
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,120
it, and then the application terminates.

71
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,670
But at least I know I connected to the database without any problem.

72
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,560
Okay.

73
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,970
In the next lecture, we'll get started with sessions.

74
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,420
Okay.

75
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,560
So let's move on.
