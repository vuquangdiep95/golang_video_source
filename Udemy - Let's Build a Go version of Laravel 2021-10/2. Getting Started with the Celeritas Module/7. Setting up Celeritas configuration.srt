1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,680
So things are coming along, but we have a lot of work left to do.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,650
And one of the things we have to get out of the way pretty early on is actually setting up the configuration

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,220
values for celebrities, not for a web application necessarily, but for the celebrities package itself.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,430
So in order to get that underway, what I'm going to do is back here in celebrities start go in the

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,010
celebrities application or project.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,410
I'm going to create a new type and these type will not be exported and it will just be called config

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,900
and it will just be a struct.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,490
And this will hold all of the configuration values for this package, and we'll just put a few in there

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:38,930
right now.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,150
So we're going to want to know things like what port are we going to listen on?

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,530
And that's a string.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,140
So when we start the application, when the final binary is built is going to listen on some port and

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,660
we'll get that, of course, from the environment variables.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,570
We also will want to know what renderer.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,450
Are we going to use so renderer, which is a string now that's referring to what template engine we

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,970
want to use, and in this course we're going to support to.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,910
We'll do a little bit first with the standard go templates and then we'll spend a lot more time on another

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,680
renderer, the jet package.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,250
So we're going to want that for certain, and that's enough right now.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,220
We'll be adding more to the config type as time goes on.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,230
So we have this type, so let's use it.

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,330
So we'll come down here after we set all these values.

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,840
And while I'm at it, I mean, this will set secret path and that will be equal to past week.

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,210
I forgot to do that last time around.

25
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,310
Let's set the application config.

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:40,350
So what I'll do here is go back up to celebrities and add another type here, which I'll call config.

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,520
And I'm not going to export that because there's no reason that any application that import celebrities

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,430
should have access to the config, so config will be of type config.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,200
OK, so that's available to us now.

30
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,030
So we come down here.

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:04,380
Just after I set the path just at the very end of the new function, and let's say see config is equal

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,990
to the type config and we'll just populate its values.

33
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,210
And of course, all we care about right now are the port, and we get that from the environment, which

34
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,070
we read when we read our dart on file.

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:25,860
OS don't get arms port all in uppercase and the renderer will be equal to again from our OS.

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,160
Don't get on because this is right in our dart on file.

37
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,970
Render it, make sure you spell it right or it's not going to work.

38
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,830
So that's available to us now throughout the entire application hour.

39
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,320
Anywhere that we share this in our Securitas package will have access to all the configuration variables

40
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,820
if we need it.

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,700
And of course, we're going to add more information to the config, like the database and the cookie

42
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,380
type and the session type in our Redis configuration and all that sort of thing.

43
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,280
But we'll add those as we need them.

44
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,580
Now, of course, our ultimate goal is to start a Web application to start a web server and listen for

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,270
requests.

46
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,090
And that's not terribly difficult to set up a basic one, and we'll get started on that in the next

47
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,530
lecture.

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,580
But right now we have our configuration, we have our lockers, we have all kinds of things that we

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,090
can use.

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,900
And I think the next step, just so we can see some tangible progress, will be to start a web server

51
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,110
from our Celerity House package and just serve something back.

52
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,490
So we know that it works and we'll get started on that in the next lecture.
