1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,620
So we've created our three handlers to test our new response types.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,110
Let's create some links in the home jet template right here.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,440
Let's also create the necessary roots in our roots file right here in my app project.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,050
So I'll create the roots right here first.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:28,890
So I'll say it again because I can do that now and I want to get slash JSON and that will go to aid

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,730
handlers, thought Jason.

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,750
I'll duplicate that and do one, for example.

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,570
And that would take us to.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,620
Well, duplicate that and say, download dash file.

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,230
It takes us to download file.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,590
OK, now let's go back to our HomeKit page and create some links there.

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,030
So I'll just duplicate this one.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,560
Make that one, Jason, and I'll label it Jason response

14
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,920
and duplicate that and call it X email response.

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,590
And it goes to slash X amount, and I'll duplicate that and make this one.

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,290
Download Dash file and download file response.

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,480
OK, so let's open our terminal and type, make restart or start or whatever you need to do to get it

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,750
running.

19
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,610
And go to our Web browser and reload this page.

20
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,290
Now I should click on Jason Response and actually get some Jason sent back.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,070
And there it is.

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:54,570
So Firefox, of course, gives you this representation, but I can look at the raw data and there it

23
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:54,900
is.

24
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,440
Absolutely perfect.

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,910
So let's go back and let's try an XML response.

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,460
And there it is now, let's view, source and make sure it's actually XML.

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,440
And it looks great.

28
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,310
So hobbies.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,920
Now has hobby three hobby entries.

30
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,110
Children of the hobbies entry.

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,840
And let's go back and make sure we can actually download a file.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,810
So this should download celebrities start JPEG.

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,730
OK, so it actually displayed it in the browser.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,540
Now that may be a function of Firefox, so what I'm going to do is open up Chrome and see what it does

35
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,390
in Chrome, because Chrome Firefox sometimes tries to be ever so helpful and it becomes a little too

36
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,560
helpful in some cases.

37
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,090
So I will go to local host four thousand.

38
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,770
And see what this does here.

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,760
So it looks like we might have something wrong in our response for downloading a file.

40
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,250
I'm going to go verify that and make sure we have it right.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,990
So handlers don't go and I'll hide my terminal.

42
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:14,780
Download file, so that takes me to celebrities, so let me switch to celebrities package and find the

43
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,340
download file response.

44
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,610
Yeah, in fact, I do have that wrong, so I'm not going to set ahead or type to this.

45
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,220
Instead, I want to set the header to content disposition, so let's try.

46
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,220
Just I'll just delete that file in a moment.

47
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,990
W dot header dot set.

48
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,480
I always get this one backwards for some reason.

49
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,230
Content disposition.

50
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:53,170
And format Sprint F and here that's where I want the rest of it, so I'll just copy this part here.

51
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,820
It's not content type, it's content disposition.

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,260
That was a silly mistake.

53
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:07,480
So let's delete that and go back to our other application and open our terminal and type make restart.

54
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,800
And switch back to Firefox and try it out again.

55
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,920
So back on screen, reload this page.

56
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,900
Download file response.

57
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,520
And this time, if I refresh this, it should download it good, so it actually served the cache response

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,100
first with the content type instead of a content disposition, but when I reload the page, it did the

59
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,750
correct thing.

60
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,840
It tries to download it.

61
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,700
So those all seem to work really well.

62
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,940
Perfect.

63
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,640
So before we leave this section, there's one more thing I want to add, and that is the convenience

64
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,530
method that you find in Laravel that allows us to encrypt or decrypt a file with a single command.

65
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:57,290
And we should add that functionality to our helpers as well, and we'll take care of that in the next

66
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,710
lecture.
