1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:06,880
So we're almost ready to try our Badger cash, but there's just a couple of things I want to do before

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,740
we do that, and I'm still insularity start go in the celebrities project and this time I'm looking

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,780
at the function listen and serve.

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,650
You'll notice here on Line 205 and my code, we're closing our database pool, but we can't assume there's

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,030
going to be a database pool.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,210
So it will be polite to wrap this in an if statement.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,950
If Cedar DB pool is not equal to nil, then we've actually opened a database connection.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,660
So then and only then do we want to defer closing it, and we actually want to do a similar thing with

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,110
Badger.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:49,450
So we can say if our badger connection is not equal to nil, then close that and the same thing with

11
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:49,920
Redis.

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,200
The problem is we actually don't have access to those variables.

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,540
So what I'm going to do is go to the top of this file and create some new variables.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,490
So I'll create one for Redis pool or mine or just I'll just.

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:10,630
Colorado's pool is a type pointer to redistrict dark pool,

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:23,860
and I'll do the same thing for Badger Verb Badger Con as he is of type pointer two Badger DB.

17
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,740
OK, so those are now available to me.

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,270
So let's go down all the way down to where we actually check to see if we're using Redis, which is.

19
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,190
Right here.

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,160
So at this point, I know I'm using Reddit, I'm either using it for the cash or for the session or

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,640
for both.

22
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:50,740
But all I have to do now is to populate that variable Reddit's pool, make that equal to my reader's

23
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,850
cash token.

24
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,740
OK, so now I have a means of actually deferring a close and making the same thing with Badger.

25
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:11,010
If we get Badger here, we can see Badger Corn is equal to my badger cash dot com.

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,900
So now if we find, listen and serve again, wherever that is down here somewhere.

27
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:28,900
We can defer closing those if they're not set to nil, if red is pool is not equal to nil, then defer

28
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,790
rent is pool that again, British pool got close.

29
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:49,850
And similarly with Badger, if badger pool for Badger Conn is not equal to nil, then defer Badger Conn.

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,970
OK, just a bit of housekeeping.

31
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,790
So now we can switch over to our my app.

32
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,370
And find our dot on file, which is here somewhere.

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,910
There it is.

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:16,310
And find our cash and change that to badger and change the comment to British or Badger.

35
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,210
And I should be able to start my application assuming that all of my darker images are running and I'm

36
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,100
pretty sure they are.

37
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,310
Make start.

38
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,750
And it does a government vendor build celerity house, everything should be current.

39
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,690
And we have an error.

40
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,240
And there is.

41
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,030
In its letter, Tostart Go Line 21.

42
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,660
And it's and celebrities don't go line 110, so let's see what we got wrong there.

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,750
Let's switch over to celebrities.

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,950
Don't go look at line one hundred and ten.

45
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,850
So it's right here where I'm adding the function daily.

46
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,110
OK, we left something out.

47
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:23,290
OK, so let's go back up to the part where before we create this, although I populated the scheduler,

48
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,370
I never actually set it.

49
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:33,190
So let's create a variable scheduler and make that assign the value of crime new, and that was silly.

50
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,100
And now we set seed on scheduler equal to scheduler.

51
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,290
That was an oversight on my part.

52
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,430
You can actually schedule a crown job until you've created a new Cron object.

53
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,430
So we'll switch back over here and try running this again next year.

54
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,360
And hopefully this time it'll at least compile.

55
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,650
There it's running.

56
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,850
So let's go to our Web browser and open a new tab and go to localhost four thousand.

57
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,240
And let's try our cash and see if we got it right.

58
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:21,550
So we'll put in ABC with the value of saving cash, and it apparently saved it.

59
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,330
Let's try getting it.

60
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,690
ABC And that worked and let's delete ABC delete from cash.

61
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,680
It is gone.

62
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,290
Everything seems to work as expected.

63
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,130
Perfect.

64
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,360
So now we have two kinds of cash is available to us, Reedus and Badger.

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,380
So let's move on.
