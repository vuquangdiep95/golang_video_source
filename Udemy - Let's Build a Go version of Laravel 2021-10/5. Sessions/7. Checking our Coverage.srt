1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,600
So now that we have a test for a session package, let's just check our coverage.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,590
So I'm still in the Celebrity House project and I'll open a terminal window and I'm at the correct directory.

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:17,320
I'm at the root level of the celebrity house directory and all I have to do is type make cover because

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,810
we're using that make file and I have a failure and the failure is render test.

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,690
Don't go line 42.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,170
I know exactly what that is.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,440
So Line 42 is failing there.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,810
It's failing because to make it fail.

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,240
A few lectures ago, I had a home to hear.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,690
Let's change that back to home so that that'll actually pass this time.

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,230
So clear the terminal window make cover.

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,890
And everything passed, and we have two files being checked, rendered Argo, which is a seventy nine

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,320
point three percent and as you can see, it's pretty good coverage.

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,740
Most of the things that fail here are not covered.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,770
Here are actually cases that I personally do not care about because I am not a purist and I don't insist

16
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,780
upon 100 percent test coverage.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,790
I know that if there's a problem with any of these, I'm going to get the appropriate error returned.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,380
So those don't bother me.

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,150
If they bother you, just jump through the hoops necessary to create the conditions where you'll get

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,890
an error here in here and here in here.

21
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,060
And that's entirely up to you.

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm not going to do that.

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,740
So let's check session eighty eight point two percent.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,110
Not bad.

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,990
And the only cases that are not covered are if someone does not put a value in the dot own file, which

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,240
we're facing up in, up here when we create our session struct in our setup, not test file.

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,290
So you could just leave that empty and write another test, it's entirely up to you, but I'm really

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,370
happy with this coverage.

29
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:40,970
Perfect.

30
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:47,270
So let's move on, and I think it's time to now start worrying about how we're going to integrate a

31
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,070
database into our application.

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,890
And in this course, we're going to take care of two databases Postgres, my favorite open source and

33
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,710
go to database and either my Escuela or MariaDB, which use exactly the same driver.

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,230
So we'll get started on that in the next section.
