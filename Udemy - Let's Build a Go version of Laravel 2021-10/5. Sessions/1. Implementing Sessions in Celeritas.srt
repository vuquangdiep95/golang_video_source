1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,420
So in this section of the course, we're going to start working with Sessions, and our goal will be

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,880
to make session management in session usage as painless as possible for the end user.

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,590
So before we do that, let's have a look at this page homeport jet and what we can do right now.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,800
This page looks like this.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,940
So there it is rendered.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,710
It's just the logo in the center with celebrities and jet templates.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,050
Let's put a menu underneath this that will link to all of the things we're going to be building for

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,410
the remainder of this course, and it will give us a very easy way to test functionality as we progress

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,020
through the course.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,030
So let's get started.

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,100
Let's go back to our editor, and first of all, I'll get rid of this bit right here.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,590
Jet templates and just put the title there and up here at the top where it says browser title.

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,130
Right now, it says celebrities are celebrities.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,670
Let's just change that to welcome.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,210
OK?

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,750
It doesn't really matter, but it makes it look nicer.

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:04,580
And right now, this one div class deflects this has a height of 100 V8, so it takes up the whole browser

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,030
window.

19
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:11,570
Let's just delete that style entirely, and let's add the class say Mty Dash five to push it down a

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:11,960
little bit.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,130
Let's see what that looks like.

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:17,750
So I'll go back and refresh this page, and that is good.

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,570
OK, so now let's add some links underneath this.

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:29,150
So let's go back to our editor and right after this, after this div, after this second to last closing

25
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:35,150
div, I'll put a horizontal rule in and then I'll put a paragraph, tag things to try

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,620
and close the paragraph tag.

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,550
And I'll put a division here with a class of straight out of bootstrap list, dash and group.

28
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,540
And I'll close that div and I'll put some entries in here.

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,980
So first of all, a f equals and we'll go to a non-existent path.

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,190
Go Dash page because this is something we've already done.

31
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:08,440
And it's class will be list Dash Group, Dash Item List, Dash Group, Dash Item, Dash action against

32
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:16,280
to bootstrap and say render a go template and close that I'm going to duplicate the line and change

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,490
it.

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,840
Change this to jet.

35
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,270
So render a jet template and that will go to Jet.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,710
Dash page and I'll duplicate that again.

37
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:31,220
And this is the one we're interested in in this section sessions and we'll say.

38
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,670
Try Sessions.

39
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,160
OK, let's see what that looks like.

40
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,040
Let's go back and refresh this.

41
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,110
All right.

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,400
So now I have three links and we can add more.

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,640
We can add our cash when we get to that and everything else we're going to build in this course.

44
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,360
OK, so let's go back and make those links active.

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,230
At least the first two.

46
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,240
So back to visual studio code, we want to have a go page and a check page.

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:04,040
So let's go to Route's rootstock, go in our Miami package and I'll just duplicate this twice and change

48
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,050
the first one to go to page.

49
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,870
And then we'll go to a handler that doesn't exist yet called Code Page like that.

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:19,010
And this one will be Gitesh Page and that will go to Jette page.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,300
OK, so now let's go back to our handlers inside the handlers folder handlers dugout, and I'll just

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,590
duplicate this and modify it.

53
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,070
So I'll copy this and paste it and paste it again.

54
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,980
This one is going to be go page and this one is going to be jet page.

55
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,680
And I want this one to not use the default rendering page function.

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,460
Instead, we'll make that go page.

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,300
OK.

58
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:54,110
And that means we get rid of this extra parameter and we'll have this render home what we already have

59
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,490
a home page to temple, which we're not using, so we can use that one that works fine.

60
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,370
And for this one again, I don't want to use page because that will use the default renderer.

61
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,110
We'll change that to jet page, and that does have the two data parameters.

62
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,290
We'll leave them both additional and we'll make that render, say, jet dash template.

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,340
So let's go create jet dash template inside our views directory.

64
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,510
So a new file.

65
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,680
Jet Dash template dot jet.

66
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,080
We can just modify the home page just to make sure that it actually works.

67
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,590
So we'll open home jet.

68
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:42,380
Select all and copy clothes that open jet template jet pasted in there and change this to, in the title,

69
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,450
say, jet template.

70
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,510
And we'll just get rid of this stuff.

71
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,600
We just added all of that and say.

72
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:01,250
This page is rendered using the jet template engine.

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,620
OK, so everything went well, I should be able to say make restart.

74
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,440
It'll stop my application, start my application.

75
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,680
And now when I go back and reload this page, this one should work.

76
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,450
It should render a go template.

77
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,180
And it does go templates.

78
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,510
And this one should work rendering a jet template.

79
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,280
And it does.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,250
This page is rendered using the jet template engine, and this one should give me a 404 page not found

81
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,790
in error.

82
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,640
And it did for a four page not found.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,450
Perfect.

84
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,190
OK, so that just gets us started.

85
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,840
So now we have a place to actually start playing with sessions when we're ready to do that.

86
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,830
So in the next lecture, let's go install a session package.
