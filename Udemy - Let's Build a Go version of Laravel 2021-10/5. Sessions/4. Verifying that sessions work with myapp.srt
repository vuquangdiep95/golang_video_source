1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,420
All right, so we have our middleware set up, we have our session initiated.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,150
Let's make sure everything is wired up correctly.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:12,730
So I'm looking at celebrities, my celebrities package and I'm looking at the middleware Dogville file.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,530
And what I'm going to do, first of all, is just make sure this middleware is getting cold.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,560
So inside of that, before the return statement, I'm going to take advantage of my info log see Dot

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,230
Info Log Dot print line.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,700
I'll just say session load call, because we're not actually going to get a cookie created until we

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,670
put something in this session or try to read something from the session.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,800
But this will tell me the middleware is firing anyway.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:49,470
So let's switch over to our My AMP project and I'll open a terminal window and I'll make sure nothing

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:49,950
is running.

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:50,910
Make stop.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,490
It's not, and I'll call make start.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,570
So there it's running now.

15
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,520
Now we'll go to my favorite web browser and I'll just go to local host Port 4000 and then we'll go check

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,150
the log file.

17
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,550
So there it came up.

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,470
Let's go look at our log file.

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,060
And it said session loads load called perfect.

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,010
So it's actually running.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,330
So now we can actually do something with sessions.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,250
So let's create a new page in the Views folder in the Miami project or create a new file, which I'll

23
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,180
call Sessions plural jack.

24
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,180
OK.

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,530
And to make things a little simpler, I'll just open up this jet template.

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,970
Copy everything out of that.

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:47,270
Paste it into Sessions jet and just say we'll will say this value came from the session, which is a

28
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,750
good start.

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,180
And of course, we'll put some value there in a bit.

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,310
OK, and we'll change this up here.

31
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,830
Two sessions.

32
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,510
Oops.

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,760
The C.J. There Sessions.

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,520
OK, so that's all we're going to do for this right now.

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,400
Now let's go to our handlers and let's create a new handler.

36
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:17,720
I'll just copy this one to make it faster, and I'll call this session test and it will render the template

37
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,850
sessions, plural.

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,660
OK.

39
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,770
And what we're going to do in here, first of all, is just set up a route and make sure this is all

40
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,730
working properly.

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:36,100
So let's go to our roots and duplicate the the jet page route right here and make that session, which

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,370
I think that's what I called it in my home page.

43
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,610
Let's make sure home jet.

44
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,670
So they're session or sessions.

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,940
It was sessions plural simple close that go back to roots at an -- and we'll call the handler session

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,300
test.

47
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:50,900
OK.

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,900
So let's now just restart our application, make restart just to make sure everything's wired up properly.

49
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,760
And then we'll worry about adding session in a bit, adding additional data in a bit.

50
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,520
So let's go back to Firefox Reload this page just to make sure everything is current, and this should

51
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,930
take me to my Sessions page.

52
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,070
And there it is.

53
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,260
This value came from the session.

54
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:19,220
Now I want to add some data to the jet template that is stored in the session, and then we'll read

55
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,050
it from the session right in the same handler and we'll see if it actually displays properly.

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:30,260
So let's go back to our code and let's go to the session test handler and let's try putting something

57
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,790
in the session, whatever it may be.

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:44,990
So we'll say my data is equal to just some text file and then I'll call H Dot app dot session dot put.

59
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,710
And you can see that requires a few parameters, the first one is the context, and we have that is

60
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,110
just out of context.

61
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:05,700
And then the key part and then the value, which is my data and this has to be an assignment operator.

62
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:07,590
All right.

63
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,360
So now we've put something in the session.

64
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,630
We're not reading it yet, but we're actually doing something with it.

65
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,900
OK, so let's try restarting our application.

66
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,130
Make restart.

67
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,650
And let's go back to our web browser, and before I do anything else, I want to open my terminal window.

68
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,500
I'm going to open a new browser tab and I'm in Firefox, so I'm going to go to my Firefox preferences.

69
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,830
And of course, they're in a different place in Chrome, but I'm sure you can find them in Firefox.

70
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm going to go to a privacy and security, then I'm going to go to manage data and I'm going to look

71
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,180
for local host.

72
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,890
I may have already cleared this out.

73
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,440
Local host, it has one cookie, so let's remove that cookie OK and save the changes.

74
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,970
Remove.

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,780
OK.

76
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,260
And I think I just did a make restart, but let's make sure I did.

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,680
Now back to Firefox and I'll go to my Celerity Sessions page.

78
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,310
I will open my developer's tools and I'll make it really wide so I can see everything and I'm going

79
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,810
to look at storage.

80
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,410
OK?

81
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,060
And what do we have for cookies?

82
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,990
Nothing right now.

83
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,060
So let's reload this page and now I have a cookie, as you can see right here.

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,250
So there's my sessional cookie being set up just the way that it should be.

85
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,990
So of course, we also want to read data from the session, then then pass it to this template so we

86
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,210
can say this value came from the session and have it say, Ooh here, and we'll take care of that in

87
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:38,990
the next lecture.
