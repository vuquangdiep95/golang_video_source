1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:06,040
So let's keep working on sessions, and before we go any further, I did leave one thing out in the

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,840
last lesson and I'm sure you noticed it.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,810
It's right here in Celerity Moscow.

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,620
It's at Line 77 or thereabouts in my code, and it's where I set the C config value.

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,480
When we added this cookie and cookie config struct, I left out the domain.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,080
So let's add that domain, and that's OK.

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:34,870
Don't get on cookie with two O's domain underscore domain.

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,250
OK.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,020
So we added that there.

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:45,400
Otherwise, when we declare our sessional variable sesh here on Line 92, the actual domain is never

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,290
going to get set.

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:01:00,370
So let's add that cookie domain and that is c the config dot cookie dot domain there.

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,480
Now, when we call it in its session, we'll have the cookie domain now would have worked without it.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,040
Probably it would just grab the default domain of what it's running on, but I like to set these things

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,620
explicitly so that's taken care of.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,540
So the next thing we need to worry about is adding that save and load middleware.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Now we actually have some middleware in our roots file right now.

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,370
And as you can see right here, we're using middleware that comes with it, she router.

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,190
But we actually want to add our own.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,770
So I'll create a new file at the root level of my celebrity house project called Middleware Dot Go.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,290
And of course, that has package main

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,190
package to alert us.

23
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,140
That's better.

24
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,880
And all we're going to do here is declare a very simple function with a receiver c pointer to celebrities

25
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,420
and we'll call it session load and it's middleware, so we will give it one parameter next each http

26
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,590
dot handler and it returns and HTP dot handler.

27
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,540
And this is as simple as calling returned, which we better spell right.

28
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,440
And we're going to return C Dot session because that's now available in our sliotars variable.

29
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,910
Dot load and save.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,460
And we just handed the parameter next, and that's it.

31
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,670
And that takes care of loading and saving our session on every request.

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,640
So that is pretty straightforward.

33
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,330
Now we go back to our roots and we say, use that.

34
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:51,000
So right here, Max, don't use and we want to use C Dot session load and there should be no further

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,140
changes required.

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,830
All right.

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,990
So in the next lesson, we'll just see if we're getting that cookie set on our requests.
