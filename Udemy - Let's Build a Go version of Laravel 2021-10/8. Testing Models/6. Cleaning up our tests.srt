1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,640
So before we leave the section on testing our data models behind, there's just a couple of typos that

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,000
I had and I'm sure you noticed them and you probably don't have them, but I do.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,710
So I'm looking at integration underscore test.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:20,970
Don't go inside the data directory in the My App project and add line 478 in my code right here near

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,100
the top of Test token bed header.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,130
I misspelled authorization.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,230
And that's not good because it's not going to do the test, and I think it's going to do so.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,840
Let's just fix that one.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,280
And then probably because I copied and pasted it right at the end of this function.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,510
I have the same problem.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,100
And that's a bit of a problem.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,800
Now one other thing I just want to draw to your attention and that's that line five hundred and fifty

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,880
two or so and it is right down here.

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,870
This isn't the test token invalid token here.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,270
My ID is given me a warning, saying the value of error is never used and in fact, I don't want it

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,660
to be used because it's going to throw an error.

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,030
All I really care about here is the OK, so I'm going to just ignore that response.

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,660
OK.

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,440
So now if I opened my terminal window and make sure I'm inside the data directory in my app what I am

20
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:23,410
and I can run my test coverage in the browser against, so I'll type go test dash cover profile equals

21
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:29,230
coverage dot out just to generate the data I can use to display it in the web browser.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,390
And that will take just as long to run as our normal test to normal integration tests because it's actually

23
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,850
running, those tests is just saving the output into a file.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,350
And once it finishes, everything passed and you notice these warnings here, it says it's an upper

25
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,440
log level equals warning in effect that in the moment too.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,890
But right now we have our output, so let's type.

27
00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:05,030
So let's clear the screen and type go tool cover dash HTML equals coverage dot out and they should fire

28
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,360
up our web browser and show us the most recent results of our test.

29
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,650
And it does.

30
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,620
So let's go over to authorization.

31
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,440
Are tokens right here and see what we have now?

32
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,470
That's looking pretty good.

33
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,470
It's eighty eight point five percent, so it's more than it was before, and it's looking pretty good.

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
OK, so that was that.

35
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,370
And of course, these tests can be improved, but we've covered the vast majority of the cases, and

36
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,030
I'll leave it as an exercise to you if you want to make any improvements or changes.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,980
Now the other thing I want to take care of is that warning from upper slash and DB where it gives us

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,150
warning logs.

39
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,010
I don't want to turn those off, and I actually went and looked at the source code for this project

40
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,090
for upper slash DB.

41
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:54,410
And let me show to you over my web browser, so I'm on upper slash and DB on GitHub dot com.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,500
Here's the source code.

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,130
And if we scroll down to the longer bit right here.

44
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,250
And we look at this source code.

45
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:08,090
You'll notice that it has these potential settings log level trace debug info warning, the one I want

46
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:08,650
is error.

47
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,670
I don't want it to be warm, which is what it defaults to.

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:18,270
OK, so let's go back to our setup integration tests where we set up integration tests, right?

49
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:18,830
Very tall.

50
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,040
And let's just do what they do so right?

51
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,320
Near the very top.

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,330
Here we are.

53
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,500
So we set an environment variable database, which we're using in our code, but it turns out that upper

54
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:41,900
DV is also using an environment variable, so we'll set it on and then when we want to set is upper

55
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:50,300
underscore DB underscore log, we want to set it to error, so it'll ignore the warning messages and

56
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,780
that just cleans it up and makes our tests ever so much easier to run.

57
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,880
OK, let's move on.
