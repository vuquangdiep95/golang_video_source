1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,090
So we've added some validation right to our data model users and the rules are last name must not be

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,580
empty, first name must not be empty, email must not be empty and email has to be in the form of a

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,720
valid email address.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,530
So let's try it.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,450
So we'll go back to our roots.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,120
Don't go right in the Maya project.

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,240
And again, I'm going to work with this update user route.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,070
So we created a validator.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:31,490
This time I'm going to delete this one rule that we have for validation, and I'm going to, at this

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,320
point, change the last name to an empty string.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,980
So I'll say you don't last name is equal to an empty string.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,310
And I know that's redundant because I said, it's value right here, but it doesn't matter.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,960
I just want this validation to fail.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:52,670
So now that I've already created my validator variable, all I have to do is call you is I have a model's

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,870
user right now.

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:01,040
Don't validate and hand it validator, and everything else should stay pretty much the same because

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,540
my validation should fail at this point.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,310
So let's try it out.

19
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,160
That's the only thing we're checking is a validation on the data model.

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,970
So I open my terminal window and I type make restart.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:26,010
And I go back to my web browser and I go to slash update slash user slash one because I have one user

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,030
on my database with the idea of one and validation should fail at this point.

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,620
And it does things work exactly as expected.

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,570
Now the great thing about this is I can put validation, basic validation on all of the models that

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,980
I'm working with on a regular basis.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,510
And calling validation, no matter where you happen to be, is as simple as calling.

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,720
Whatever the variable is, you for user, for example, don't validate and hand it an instance of the

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,350
validator.

29
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,140
Now this is all well and good, but it might be helpful at this point to actually build a web page and

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,740
try a real form validation as it should exist.

31
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,500
So we'll take care of that in the next lecture or two.
