1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,400
So it's almost time to run commentary, but I have a couple of things I need to clean up first.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:11,870
I'm looking at the file newco in the CMD Seelye folder of the celebrities project and right here where

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,560
I call update source.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,620
Before I do that, I really should change directories, and it wouldn't be a huge deal if there were

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,920
no go files beside the place where I run this command.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,090
But I really don't want to affect anything except what's in the directory that this function creates.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,430
So I'll call OS.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:38,330
HDR changed here and I want to change to dot slash plus app name and then run that update source.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,780
OK.

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,330
And the other thing I want to change and this is just because I've been working with Go for so long.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,220
Back in Helpers Dot Go.

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,180
Where I call, read, file and write file.

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,700
I used what it used to be prior to go one point one six and that's I.O.U. tell and it really should

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,430
be OS that was updated in Go 16.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,860
Go one point one six.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,640
So let's make that OS, and let's save our file and make sure that everything works the way that it

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,180
should.

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,320
We imported OS and we don't have our utility more perfect.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,740
OK, so that was just a little bit of housekeeping.

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,830
Now back to our running go my tidy.

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:27,290
So by the time I get to line 123 in this function in this file, new don't go, I've already changed

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,730
to the app directory, the one that we created at the very beginning of this file.

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,820
So now I want to run go on tidy.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,230
So again, color yellow just to let them know what's going on.

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,770
Indent it one tab running go lord tidy dot dot dot.

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,150
And now let's run it.

27
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,450
And this is really simple.

28
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:55,970
We'll create a command CMD, which is assigned the value of from the exact package in the standard library

29
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,670
dot command.

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,510
And we give it the command go and then mod and then tidy.

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
And this might not work, but we'll try it in.

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,710
In a moment we might have to put a compatibility flag in there and on the next line, we'll run it.

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:22,880
Error equals seemed to start and we checked for an error, so I'll just copy all of this and paste it

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,390
in here.

35
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,960
And now put a little bit of message out for the user.

36
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:40,090
Similarly, a pass that we can print colored green done building plus app name.

37
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:47,410
Actually, they typed up you URLs, put that you are out there and colored green.

38
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:54,370
Whatever else you want to say, go build something awesome.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,770
OK.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,630
So at this point, I should be able to build my seelye.

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:08,110
Let's open our terminal window and type, make, build and actually create a file called celebrities

42
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,430
in the dist directory.

43
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,710
Let's go to the disk directory.

44
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,730
And let's try running it now, it might fail because it might try to go and fetch GitHub dot com slash

45
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,970
tea seller slash hilarious, and I haven't pushed that up there yet, but we should get something anywhere.

46
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,740
So let's type.

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,950
Dot slash celebrity's new and I'll call it GitHub dotcom slash TESOL Solr new project.

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,810
So clumsy and everything seemed to run the way that it was supposed to.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,960
OK, so let's try opening that folder or create a new window.

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,870
And I will open the file open.

51
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:07,650
And I'll find where I have that thing actually stored, which would be in here under celerity, us under

52
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,730
dist right here in open new project.

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,680
And that's what I want to open.

54
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,520
And let's make sure everything worked as it supposed to.

55
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,010
So I'll zoom the window and I'll open.

56
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,760
Mean, don't go.

57
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,050
So it has GitHub dot com slash Tesla slash new project slash data perfect, and it's importing that

58
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,650
perfect.

59
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,160
And there is no don't get directory that looks promising.

60
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,780
Let's see what the errors are in here.

61
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,560
OK?

62
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,480
The only error it has is that it can't find GitHub dot com slash TESOL or slash alerts.

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,060
And that makes sense because I haven't pushed that there yet.

64
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,020
But that's exactly what we're going to do in the next lecture.
