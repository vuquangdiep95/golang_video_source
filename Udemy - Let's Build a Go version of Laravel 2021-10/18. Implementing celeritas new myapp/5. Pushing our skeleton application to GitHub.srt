1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,360
All right.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,820
So the next step is to push our bear application, and that's what I have opened right now in visual

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,610
studio code.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,830
We're going to push that up to GitHub.

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:16,730
But before I do that, we're going to create one more file in here, just called Read Me, M.D. and

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:27,020
inside of that, I'm just going to put a hash mark and I'll just put a celebrity's skeleton application.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,650
It's always nice to have a read me up on GitHub, and I'm just going to put that in there.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,970
You can put whatever you want in there.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,430
Ultimately, of course, you would put some language about how to download the binary and how to run

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,240
it in the fact that you don't need to clone this application, but it's entirely up to you, and this

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,980
is sufficient for my purposes right now.

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,040
So now I'm going to open a terminal in visual studio code, and I'll give myself a little more room

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,370
here.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,250
And I'll initialize a jet repository, so get not fit, get in it.

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:00:59,600
OK.

16
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,310
And you might see different messages than I do here, but don't worry about it typing get in.

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,710
It will actually create an empty git repository.

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,690
Now I need to add everything into it.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,480
So before I do that, why don't I create also a get ignore file?

20
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,830
So I'll create a new file.

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,350
And this will just tell Git what not to put in there.

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,870
So Git ignored its dot git i.g.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,910
A.R.T. all lowercase, and I'm sure you've used it before.

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,470
Inside of that?

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,870
Sometimes I work with actually most of the time when I'm not recording lectures, I work with jet brains,

26
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,510
products and forego.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,180
I use go land, so I'm going to ignore the idea folder.

28
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,460
And that's not created by Visual Studio.

29
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,920
Code is created by jet brains, but lots of people use it.

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,260
And I'm also going to ignore discovery or coverage out.

31
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,620
OK, that's enough.

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,350
You can put whatever else you want to ignore into that folder.

33
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,290
And now I'll say get ad done.

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,000
That adds everything.

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,260
Yet commit dashcam and I'll just type initial entry.

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,540
And that's the message.

37
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,190
OK, so now I've created my git repository.

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,570
I've created the necessary don't get ignore to ignore certain files and I've added everything to it.

39
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:22,520
Now I'm going to go to my web browser where I'm already logged into GitHub and I'll create a new repository

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,950
and I'm going to name it exactly the same thing that I named it in my Seelye when we wrote those few

41
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,940
lines of code that will actually clone a remote kit repository and I called mind Solara toss up.

42
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,660
OK.

43
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,160
And I'm going to make sure it's set to public and I'll create the repository.

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,380
And I don't need to create a new repository on the command line, I just did that.

45
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,270
I want to push an existing one, so I'm just going to copy all of this by clicking a little button here,

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,730
and it should be copied at that point.

47
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,390
I'll go back to my I.D. Make sure I'm in the terminal.

48
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,960
Clear the screen and paste that text in turn.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,630
There it should all be set up.

50
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,100
So now if I switch back to my web browser and just click on the name of the repository in the top left

51
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,160
hand corner, I should see my read me file down here and all of my files showing up here.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,240
Perfect.

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,720
So now that we have this repository and it's a public repository and I know the URL to it, I can go

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,540
back and compile my application, my command line application, and just see if the cloning logic works

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,080
the way that we think it's going to, and we'll take care of that in the next lecture.
