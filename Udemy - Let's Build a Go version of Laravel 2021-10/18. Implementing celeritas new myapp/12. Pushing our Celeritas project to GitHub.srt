1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:07,270
So in order to make the celebrity horse new, whatever your project name is functional, we of course,

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,870
have to push our celebrity project to a public git repository.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,520
So I'm looking at the celebrities project right now, and the first thing I'll do is create a don't

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,680
get ignored file

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,860
just to make sure things I don't want committed to my repository are not committed.

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,230
So as I did last time, I put that idea, and of course, that's for jet brains projects.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,420
If you ever worked with jet brain software, you'll know that it creates a idea folder.

8
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,630
And I don't want coverage dot out to go up there, and I don't want my guest directory to go in there

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,230
as either.

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,230
Not shabby enough.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,930
And I'll also create a read me file.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,450
I'll just leave it empty.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,000
Just put a title in.

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,290
Read me to me and in here I'll put celebrities.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,190
And of course, you put actual read me information there, but I'm just going to put it in there.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,480
So we have a read me file on the repository.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,490
Now I'll open my terminal window, make sure I'm in the right directory.

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,490
I'm in the root level of my celebrity celebrity house project.

19
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:20,920
So type, get in it and get ad dot and get commit m initial entry.

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,790
OK, so everything's been committed to get.

21
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:36,060
Now I'll switch over to my web browser and create a new repository, and I'll make the name match exactly

22
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,010
what I used everywhere.

23
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:45,510
My source code, which is just pea, solar slash, solara toss and I'll make sure it's public and create

24
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,630
it.

25
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,990
And then copy this code or these commands, push an existing repository from the command line, so I

26
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:00,260
copy those, switch back to my terminal, paste them in and hit return.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,150
And that should do it.

28
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,730
So now we'll go back and make sure it's there.

29
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,910
Celebrities, it's all there, perfect, so now that I've committed this to a committed and pushed it

30
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,430
to a remote repository, I should be able to try it out and see if we got everything right and we'll

31
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,230
take care of that in the next election.
