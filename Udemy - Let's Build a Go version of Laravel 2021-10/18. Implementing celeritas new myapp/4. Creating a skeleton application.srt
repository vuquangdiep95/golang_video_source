1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:08,800
So the next step in this process is to create a version of my app that will be basically an empty skeleton,

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,950
and the easiest way to do that is to do what I've already done.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,950
First of all, backup your existing My App project, create a zip file from it, do whatever you need

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,560
to to make sure you don't lose the work you've done so far and then create a copy of this application

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,610
in a different folder.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,500
I called mine bare BRT because it's a bare application.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,890
I just stuck it on my desktop.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,560
So once you've done that and please do, make sure you backup your existing code first.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,390
Open it up in Visual Studio Code and you'll see that there's a bunch of errors and we don't care about

10
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,290
those because we're going to be deleting things.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,400
And for example, if I open up the image, celebrities don't go file.

12
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,440
It says, I can't find that project.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,970
I know because that project doesn't exist yet, and that's just fine by me.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:59,020
So don't worry about that, but let's look at the things we want to get rid of, for example.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,590
In my data folder, I have coverage out well, that doesn't need to be put there, so let's delete that.

16
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,420
So I'll move that to the trash.

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,220
I don't want the integration test, I don't want the models test, I don't want the remember token or

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,820
set up test or test go or token go or user ID go because in a bare application, none of those would

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,320
exist.

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,320
So let's delete those.

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,360
So those are gone.

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,090
Now let's open up models and see if yes, it's referring to things that don't belong there.

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,230
So let's delete those.

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,000
And down here, we'll delete these because we don't have it users or tokens, so those will be gone.

25
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,600
And I think that's all we have to worry about for that one so we can delete that.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,580
And now let's open up handlers, so I don't want the off handlers.

27
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,080
Those can go for sure.

28
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,970
Convenience, don't go.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,720
Let's look at that.

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,310
So, yeah, I'll leave all of those there because they're not going to hurt anything.

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,960
Get rid of the form veil handlers and the test handler.

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,760
Those can go.

33
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,720
And let's look in Handler's stock, go, do I want cash handlers?

34
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,920
No, I don't want those at all.

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,580
OK.

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:21,290
So those can be gone because we were just providing our users with the ability to use the cash.

37
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,290
We're not going to implement the cash for them.

38
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,690
We're going to give them the easy method of just using it if they want to.

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,930
Now let's look up Handler's dog, go and see what's in there.

40
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,430
So.

41
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,760
I do want a home page.

42
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,000
OK, so I'm going to leave that one alone, but I'll get rid of this comment that I did, and I don't

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,780
want anything else.

44
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:48,020
I can delete all of these because these were just things for us to work with as we were testing functionality.

45
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,790
So we're going to leave one handler home, OK, and we will make sure there's a home page for them to

46
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,220
look at.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,330
So that takes care of the handlers folder and we can close that actually go back to the handlers folder.

48
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,340
I think I saw an error there.

49
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,600
Yeah, get rid of format because we're not using it there.

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,310
So let's close that.

51
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,690
Logs is fine.

52
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,130
It's empty mail.

53
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,240
What's inside of that?

54
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,570
Well, we want that to be completely empty.

55
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,520
We don't want a single template in there, so we'll delete all of those.

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,420
Migrations had better be empty, so I still eat that.

57
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,480
The temp is empty views.

58
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:38,820
I'm going to leave the layouts and I'll get rid of everything that's not home so that and that I'll

59
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,680
leave the home Typekit will delete all of those.

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,860
And let's open a home and get rid of this entire thing down here that says things to try so that can

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,430
go away.

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:01,360
And we'll get rid of this if it is authenticated, but so that can go away and the rest, that should

63
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,780
be fine.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,980
So we'll close that.

65
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,350
The dot on the file aisle to lead entirely, because we're going to create that from our command line

66
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,100
application.

67
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,630
Let's make sure there's nothing inconvenience go that looks fine.

68
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,990
Coverage can go

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,040
and Docker compose picture anything in there that I need to change.

70
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,610
No, I think that's fine.

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,330
There's no password, you know, that we care about, except.

72
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,920
These ones and those are fine for development.

73
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,960
We can close that.

74
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,780
What about go dot Dontnod?

75
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,920
Well, let's open that up.

76
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,680
We definitely want to get rid of this bit.

77
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:54,480
Replace GitHub dot com whatever your URL is with a reference to a local folder named Celebrity.

78
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:03,580
So let's delete that, OK, and close that code to some that's going to be actually created when we

79
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,990
run, Goldman Tidies.

80
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,700
So I'll delete that as well.

81
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,750
And rootstock up, something's going to have to change there, so we don't need the mailer.

82
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,390
We'll leave that one alone and we'll just leave the route to the home page, and that's pretty much

83
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,470
it so we can go all the way down here and leave the static route and delete the rest of those.

84
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,790
And this should be a nice, clean file right now.

85
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,060
OK, so we can get rid of this and we can get rid of this because it is reused by roots.

86
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,680
I just deleted and that will show up properly when we're ready to work with this.

87
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,920
OK, so I think that clears this out pretty well.

88
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,110
Let's just make sure there's nothing in the in the public folder I images.

89
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,660
OK, that should be fine.

90
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,880
This is a good starting point.

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,060
OK, so the next step is to push this up to GitHub or your favorite git repository system.

92
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,640
I'm going to use GitHub because it's very easy to use free and extremely common in the go world.

93
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,660
So let's move on.
