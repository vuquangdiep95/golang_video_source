1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:07,070
So it's time to try our celebrity's new functionality and see what we got wrong, and I'm pretty sure

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,880
we got something wrong.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,590
But anyway, let's run it and try it.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:17,630
So am I still a toss up and I am going to run make built and that should build a Seelye version, my

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,600
C-list celebrity application into the disc directory.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,520
So if I change into the Disc Directory, I'm doing less unless there is.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,000
So that's the latest version.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:34,370
Now I've already opened up my bare application from way back when and when I opened it up.

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,470
I noticed that I, in fact did forget to delete all of the middleware in here because we don't need

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,340
any of this.

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,520
All of this is actually except for the middleware go file.

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,510
So those should be gone.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,010
And they are.

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,980
And now I'll go to my OK version control and committees.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,600
Delete unused files.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
So commit those.

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,470
And I'll push them.

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,310
And I go back to my Web browser, and I'll refresh this page to make sure it's the current version,

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,960
I'm looking at my Celerity app project in middleware that should just be one file in there.

20
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,500
That's better.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,580
So now when I run celerity, this new everything should work as expected.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:28,760
So I have my bare application here and let me switch back over to celebrities and I will copy my celebrity's

23
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,720
executable.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,870
And yours might be called Celebrity X.

25
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,330
But I'm going to copy it to the location where I want to run it, which is my desktop, so I'll copy

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,050
it to my desktop.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
And if you want to just click and drag.

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,430
Get it on your desktop somehow.

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:53,720
OK, so it's on my desktop now, so I'll open another terminal window by clicking the plus sign and

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,530
go to my desktop.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:05,490
Or wherever you put the file and I'll try running dot slash house new and I'll just call it cool app.

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,050
OK, so Klum's, it puts it all down there and it's finished.

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,030
Let's open a new window.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,130
And zoom in and open the folder on your desktop.

35
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,010
So I'll open from my desktop.

36
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,030
I'm looking for cool app right there and I'll open this up.

37
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,180
And in theory, I should be able to open my terminal window.

38
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,450
And type make start is probably not going to work the first try.

39
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,620
Nothing ever does.

40
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,970
And there is the first problem.

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,740
It tries to download two solar celerity version zero zero zero.

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,280
And of course, that's something we'll have to change in the go.

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,060
Don't modifier.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
Let's see what we have to change it to.

45
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,010
So I'll simply delete this line entirely.

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:07,400
The one that says the refers to alertness and close this file and clear the screen and type.

47
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:15,890
Go get GitHub dot com, slash Tesla slash celebrities and see what it does.

48
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,370
OK.

49
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,310
So I downloaded it.

50
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:20,840
That's good.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,610
Now let's type make start and see if it all compiles and runs.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,640
Imported and not used, so there's something else we have to clear it that some handlers don't go.

53
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,830
So let's open up handlers.

54
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,730
We left a reference to Jet in there.

55
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,200
So should you be able to save this might goes away.

56
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,670
Good.

57
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,430
We'll close that.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,140
So that's a second thing we're going to have to fix.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,150
Let's do that right now.

60
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:54,790
Let's go over to bear your bear application and open your handlers right there.

61
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,190
And delete that one.

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,800
Save that.

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,850
OK.

64
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,420
And let's go back now and try running that again.

65
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,160
So back to cool app three are for the screen.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,640
See if the third time is the charm.

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,190
Make sure.

68
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,810
OK.

69
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,270
Add up middle, weird check, remember undefined and that is in roots.

70
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,960
There's something else we have to change.

71
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,740
OK to recap and go back to our beer application.

72
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,030
Right here and find roots.

73
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,820
And doing that right now, let's commit all of these changes.

74
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,790
So remove unused code commit.

75
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,210
And push.

76
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,690
OK, and now let's go back and try running it again.

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,040
So I'm back to cool air and clear the terminal.

78
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,180
Start.

79
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,550
Perfect.

80
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,240
It's running.

81
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,100
So let's try running this or see what this does.

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,580
We'll go over to our browser and type local host four thousand.

83
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,920
And it works perfect.

84
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:38,440
OK, so we need to make a change now to our celebrities project, so let's find that celebrities and

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,780
what we wanted to change was.

86
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,560
In our CMT folder, templates go dark mode.

87
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,380
We want to get rid of this part.

88
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,380
What I'm going to do is put in V one point zero point zero because I want to make sure that I'm downloading

89
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,600
exactly the version that I want to download.

90
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,110
OK.

91
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,320
So I am referring to a tag version one point zero point zero, and I don't think I've tagged it over

92
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,650
here.

93
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,170
So go back to my celebrity's project.

94
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,790
Go to the root level and there are no releases, so let's create a new release.

95
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,930
I will tag this.

96
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,570
Has the one point zero point zero.

97
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:21,750
OK.

98
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,860
And I will because I missed that.

99
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,490
There it is.

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,550
OK.

101
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,510
Publish the release and I'll call this initial release, publish the release.

102
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:34,860
There it is.

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,470
So now when I go back to my celebrity's project, let's try this one last time.

104
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,760
So I'm going to, first of all, find the cool app.

105
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,680
So I'm going to, first of all, close my cool art project altogether.

106
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,130
There's beer celebrities cooler, so I'll close this.

107
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,270
I'll stop it first.

108
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,150
Make stop and I'll close this.

109
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,660
And then I'll remove the folder cool app, or I'm or RF Cool app, and you can just drag yours to the

110
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,780
folder or to the trash if you're using windows or use whatever the equivalent command is in your favorite

111
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,140
show.

112
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,600
And now we'll go back to my other terminal.

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,320
Here and I will go up one level, rebuild my seal, I make build.

114
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,440
Go to the dust folder and copy celebrities back to the desktop folder.

115
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:48,290
And now will switch to my other terminal window and Typekit slash celebrity's new cool app to.

116
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,630
OK.

117
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,570
Now open a new window in visual studio code Zoom to

118
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,040
open the cool app to folder.

119
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,830
From the desktop cool app to open.

120
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's see if we missed anything else.

121
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,460
So open my terminal window and type make start.

122
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,230
So it's building it, that's a good sign.

123
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,490
The delay is that it's downloading celebrities and all the associated packages, of course.

124
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,460
And it started it.

125
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,310
And can I see it in my Web browser?

126
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,470
Let's just reload this page.

127
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,970
Perfect.

128
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,270
So there you go.

129
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:57,130
We have a fully functional application that allows us to specify a database easily, a cache, easily.

130
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,980
It has management for sessions, for user authentication.

131
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,400
It has all of the things I need to get started building an application.

132
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,460
Well, that was fun.

133
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,820
OK, let's move on to the final section of this course, and that's just where to go next section.
