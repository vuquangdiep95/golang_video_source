1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,550
So let's try out the rendering a jet template, and we will actually use a jet template this time around.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,180
We'll do that in the next lecture or the one after that, we'll just make sure that things work as expected.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,720
So if you look in my I'm looking in the My App project, and if you look in my views folder, I have

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,720
a file I've created called test jet Typekit.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,480
And all that's in it is a line of text.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,440
This is from jet.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,090
OK, so create one of those.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,200
Then let's go to our roots file and let's try this out.

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,140
So before we do that, of course, I have to open my terminal window and type go mode vendor just to

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,600
get the latest version of celebrities in my vendor folder there.

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,190
That's done.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,800
It will just create a test route right here.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,240
A really simple one and will inline everything so we won't even create a handler this time around.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:57,000
So a dot app dot roots don't get because we're just going to make a get request to slash jet and in-line

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,690
a function here.

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:10,020
Func Whv Typekit Response Writers is the first parameter and our a pointer to don't request is the second

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,470
parameter.

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:20,280
And we'll just call a Dot App Dot Render Jet page there, and that requires a few parameters.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,480
W R and the name of my template is test jet without the extension.

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,270
And then Neil and Neil for the two days.

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,780
OK.

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,770
So let's give that a try.

23
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,910
So we'll open our terminal and type make start.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,690
And go to my Web browser and let's go to HP Collins slash local host 4000 and we should get the go templates.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,440
There it is.

26
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,560
And now let's put slash check after that.

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,700
And there it is.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,020
This is from Jack.

29
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:58,740
So our render functionality using templates, both go templates and jet templates works as expected.

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,740
But the great thing about this, if you go back to our roots file, is that I can call Jet Page directly

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,440
or I could call go page directly, or I can just call page and go with the default one.

32
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,560
So that works really well.

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:17,340
So in the next lecture, we'll try creating a handler and creating some actual jet templates and play

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,090
with that for a bit.

35
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,950
And then we'll write some tests.
