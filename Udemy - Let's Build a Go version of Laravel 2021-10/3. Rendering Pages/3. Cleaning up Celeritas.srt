00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:06,040
Before we move on to working with jet templates in our render package, I just want to do a little bit

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,580
of cleanup.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,870
A couple of lectures ago we created this function you see here in celebrities don't go in the celebrities

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,900
package and it's called Create Renderer, and I clearly was caffeine deprived, but I put this together

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,680
because this is far more complex than it actually needs to be.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,370
First of all, we don't need to return anything here at all.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,780
And secondly, we don't need a parameter here at all.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,960
In fact, we have access to everything we need right from the receiver.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,500
So we're not going to return anything here.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,210
And these become CS.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:55,450
And all we have to do here is say, see, dot rendered is equal to my render a reference to my render.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:03,280
OK, and then back up here, of course, that means we need to simplify this code to nothing more than

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,790
this.

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,000
And get rid of that parameter.

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,600
And that is ever so much better.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,590
OK.

17
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,360
So that which is a little bit of clean up.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,640
And as I said, that was unnecessarily complicated code where it was passing parameters and changing

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,100
the receiver, and I could have done everything with the receiver.

20
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,680
I blame it on a distinct lack of caffeine.

21
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:24,820
So let's move on.
