1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,910
So let's get started working with jet templates, and right now I'm in the My App project and I'm looking

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:13,160
at the dart on file, and the very first thing I'm going to do is change my default renderer right here

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,330
at the very end of the file from go to jet.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:23,290
OK, and then I'll delete Test Jetport Jet because I don't need that anymore, so I'll just delete that.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,180
Yes.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,400
Move it to the trash and I'll go to my roots file and I'll get rid of this as well.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,140
That temporary route we wrote last time just to make sure that everything worked as expected.

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:42,190
OK, so now we're back as we were just before the previous lecture, except we've removed the handler,

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,540
the test handler and the roots file, and we've made that one change in the dart on file.

10
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,280
So now let's go to our Reviews folder, and let's get started with jet templates.

11
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:51,910
Right in here.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,590
I'm going to create a new folder inside of The View's folder, and I'm going to call it layouts ella

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,610
y o ut's OK.

14
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:09,850
And inside of layouts, or create a new file called Base Dot Jet, and it will be our base layer.

15
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,350
So and if you look at the course resources for this lecture, you'll find the file.

16
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,600
You can download code based object, just download it and move it into this folder or copy and paste

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,670
its contents as I am right now, because there's no point in your watching me, right?

18
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,440
Basic jet template.

19
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,260
It's very straightforward.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,420
This is a simple HTML file with some jet directors on it.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,860
Now the next thing I want to do is I'm going to make my life a little bit easier by going here and choosing

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,980
extensions and searching for jet right there.

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,470
And you can see the second from the top right now as I search is the jet template engine.

24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,120
Let's try that and see if it works.

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,500
I've actually never used it before.

26
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,700
We're about to find out.

27
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,110
So I'll install it.

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,630
There it is.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,920
It's now installed.

30
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,610
Now, if I go back to base jet, that's much cleaner.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,490
OK, now this is a base layout template, and as you might expect from a good template engine we can

32
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:13,270
actually do includes some yields and all that sort of thing, sort of like blade templates in the Laravel

33
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,600
world.

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,780
Now this is a really simple template.

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,640
It's a basic HTML file HTML five that imports bootstrap and that has some directives.

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,880
For example, here on Line eight, I have yield browser title and you'll notice that it has opening

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,030
and closing parentheses and you do need those.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,870
OK, so this is something that I can override on any template that uses this layer.

39
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,570
Similarly, down here I have CSC.

40
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:46,920
If I want to have custom CSC on a per page basis, I have the basic content and a word of caution.

41
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,620
Don't ever name your content area content.

42
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,320
That's a reserved word in the template world.

43
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,020
So instead of call it page content and down here, I might have JavaScript on a per page basis.

44
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,000
So there is my basic base template for this project.

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,790
Now, inside of the View Views folder, I'm going to create a new file not in the layouts, but in in

46
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,600
the views folder.

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,270
And I'll call it HomeKit.

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,300
And let's make sure that this template uses the one we just built, so it extends and this is not a

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,660
standard go template directive, it's one specific to jet.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,380
It extends in double quotes, dot slash layouts, slash they jet.

51
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:39,150
OK, so now it knows that it's going to use that base template and I'll have the block and I'll call

52
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,750
it system like that with the quotation, with the double parentheses around it or after it, I'll just

53
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,520
say and not put anything in there.

54
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,310
And down here, I'll say block.

55
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,950
And this one is page content.

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:02,790
I'll just leave it empty for now, and I'll fill it in in a minute and then I'll have block Jess.

57
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:13,720
And not surprisingly, and an I'm going to put it in here right now is I'll open up my home page at

58
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,820
10 p.m. and I'll copy this stuff right here.

59
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,680
OK, so I copy that.

60
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:28,560
Everything is in between the body text, and I'll go back to home jet and I'll paste it in there and

61
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,900
then I'll make sure I've got what I actually need in here.

62
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,960
So starting with a div container and it's ending with that and what's in my base jet?

63
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,300
I have a div container, so all I really need is the call that the innermost column.

64
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,930
So I'll get back to home jet and find the inner most, which is this right here?

65
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,880
And I'll delete these too, which means I can delete these two and I'll just bring this over to make

66
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,680
it format a little bit nicer.

67
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:58,960
OK?

68
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,330
And as you can see, this is now very, very easy to work with a page that extends the base layer.

69
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,720
Now let's go over to our handlers.

70
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,330
Now, let's change this.

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,340
Instead of saying, Well, you do have to change anything, I don't think I need to change a thing.

72
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,650
This should all work.

73
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,590
So let's say make stop in our terminal.

74
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,330
Make start.

75
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,530
And with no other changes, I should be able to reload that page, so let me go back to my browser and

76
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,910
go to the top here and get rid of slash jack because that URL doesn't exist anymore.

77
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,660
And Chris return.

78
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,010
And I have nothing.

79
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,800
So we have unresolved block browser title I something.

80
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:57,180
So back to my home, Joe, and we'll put the block browser title, block browser title.

81
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,580
And in there, I'll just say celebrities house doesn't matter content and save that now because I'm

82
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,480
in development mode.

83
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,420
When we set up our jetset at the very couple of lectures ago, I shouldn't have to restart my application.

84
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,870
And that's why I put that directive in there, because it makes things a little simpler.

85
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,460
So back to my web browser.

86
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,160
And there it is now, it says, go templates, let's make it sure it's actually that one because it's

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,090
not true anymore.

88
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:32,500
We'll go back to Visual Studio code and say Jet templates in Honda Jet.

89
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,180
Go reload that page.

90
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,530
And there it is.

91
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,020
So that works as expected.

92
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,940
All right now I'm going to stop developing new code for the next lecture or two, and we'll start writing

93
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,340
some tests because we have written any tests at all.

94
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,630
And that's generally frowned upon in pretty much any programming language.

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,750
But particularly when you're dealing with the go, people expect to see tests, particularly employers,

96
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,360
even employers who aren't entirely sure what a test is.

97
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,310
They look for those files, so we better write some and we'll get started on that in the next election.
