1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,550
So in this section of the course, we're going to be working with databases and we're going to be working

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,030
with post-cruise and maestro.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,290
We're actually MariaDB, which is a drop in replacement for MySchool and a bit later on in the course,

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,970
we're also going to be working with Reddit's.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,070
And I think the simplest way to get these three things installed is using Docker.

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,210
And of course, if you don't have Docker installed, the first step is to install Docker.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,730
So I have links to three resources here on the course resources for this lecture.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,100
One is how to install Docker on a Mac.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,810
And there's two big buttons here.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,970
If you have an Intel chip like I do, this is the one you want if you're fortunate enough to have an

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,080
M1 chip or one of Apple's chips.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,300
This is the one you want, so download that and install it.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,730
And it's really, really straightforward if you're on windows.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,460
Of course, this is the one you want.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,740
And again, it's very, very simple to install it.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,670
All of the instructions are here and there.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,230
They're detailed very well.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,250
And if you're on Linux, chances are you're not going to have any difficulty installing it.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,540
Your favorite package manager for whatever your district is probably has Docker.

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,320
And if not, there are instructions here for Ubuntu.

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,920
But there's all kinds of resources out there for how to install Docker on Linux.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,720
So get that installed in in.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,510
The next lesson will use a Docker compose file to install Postgres, Redis and Maria DB as Docker images.
