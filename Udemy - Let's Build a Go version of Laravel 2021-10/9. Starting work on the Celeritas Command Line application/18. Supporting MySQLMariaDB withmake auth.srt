1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,510
So the last thing I want to do in this section before we move on to validation is to support make off

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,660
for people who are using MariaDB or my ask you out.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,800
So I'm back in the Celebrity House package I'm looking at mean doggo.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:21,340
And of course, right here in the first switch statement in the main function, we want the case where

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,970
it's make.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,860
So we're going to we're going to do make.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,170
So I'll come and click on that.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,850
And of course, I want to make Auth, which takes me to the function do off.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,420
And all I really have to do here, if you look at it, is we're building the file name for the create

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,930
off tables, but we're reading it from here on line 17 copy file from template templates, migration

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,990
auth underscore tables dot db type.

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:56,560
OK, so let's create a new file in our Templates folder under migrations and we'll call it off underscore

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,190
tables.

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,040
Dot Mostue out the sequel, so create a new file

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,290
auth underscore tables.

16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:12,460
Dot my scroll dot sequel, and if you go to the course resources for this lecture, you'll find a file

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,910
you can download that gives you the necessary sequel.

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:21,010
So I already have that copy to my clipboard, so I'm just going to paste it in, and there we go.

19
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,450
It's very straightforward.

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,250
There's nothing surprising here.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,250
It's a simple, simple file that creates all of the necessary tables and relations for authentication.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,650
All right, let's move on to the next section and figure out how we're going to implement data validation.
