1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:06,280
So let's try it or make off command, and of course, it's not complete yet, but it should at least

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,840
create the necessary tables.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,670
But before we go too much further here in Austin, go inside the CMD Seelye folder of the celebrities

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,540
project probably want to put a slash after migration's.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,980
Otherwise, we're not going to have valid path names and I will probably create files, but not where

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,140
we expect and not with the name we expect.

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,460
OK, so that's out of the way.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,760
Now I'll build my seelye, so I open my terminal window and make sure I'm at the root level of my celebrity

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,530
house project.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,970
I am, and I will say, make build underscore C.R and hopefully that will complete without an error.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,970
It did.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,090
Now I'll switch over to my My App project, and I'll clear the screen here.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,480
I'll delete any migrations that are in there right now.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,750
So those are now gone.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,260
And now I'm going to go back to my database client, make sure I'm connected to my Solaris house, Docker.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,410
I am just going to select all of these tables launched.

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,460
You know, I'll do it as a sequel query and might not be using the same database function as I am.

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:20,350
So I will say drop tables, table users cascade and execute that and hopefully delete them.

19
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,710
Let's find out about go back to celebrities, refresh those and apparently didn't get rid of remember

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,090
tokens.

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:31,140
So I'll delete that one and I'll get rid of these two as well.

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,810
I don't know what happened there, but anyway, it doesn't matter.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,750
They are now gone, so I emptied my database.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,860
So there are no tables in there at all.

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,320
There's nothing in my migrations folder.

26
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,380
So let's try running dot slash celebrities, make off and see if we get it right.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:59,400
So it has my printing to the log file, as it did before, and there are my authentication tables and

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,600
hopefully those migrations ran, so I'll go back to my database client and refresh this there.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,580
There I have my tokens, my users and I remember tokens.

30
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,620
OK, now just before we go any further, let's try this make migrate down.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,720
And of course, I have to put dot celebrities in front of that dot slash celebrities and see if it deletes

32
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,210
those tables the way that I think it's going to.

33
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,950
So it's run.

34
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,620
Let's go back and have a look at our database client and see what tables are left.

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,140
And it didn't delete any of them.

36
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,220
I wonder why.

37
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,270
Let's look at our down migration drop table.

38
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,530
If exists, users cascade.

39
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,650
So obviously that one which I did for memory isn't the one that I want.

40
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,210
Well, this so we can actually manually delete those tables and fix this down migration, and we'll

41
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,260
take care of that and start copying files in the next lecture.
