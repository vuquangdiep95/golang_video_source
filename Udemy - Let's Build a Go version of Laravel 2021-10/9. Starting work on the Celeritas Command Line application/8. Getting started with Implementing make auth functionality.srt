1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,090
So now that we're more or less sure the migrations work as they should.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,730
Let's get started on making a new command for our celebrities come online application and it will be

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:18,230
make off and that will do everything necessary to in one step with one command set up the necessary

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:25,490
database tables, create the necessary models and everything else we need to do to make sure that authentication

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,890
is created very easily for end users.

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,990
So right now, I'm in this alert house package and I'm looking at Mango, and obviously we're going

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,860
to have to have a command down here that says make off.

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,830
Now we already have make render that takes us to do mix.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,630
So let's go look at that.

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,430
Do make, says one case migration.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,790
So let's add a second case here.

12
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,300
OK.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,820
And it would be right here.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,620
Case.

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,530
And rather than putting all of the logic right in this switch statement, because there's going to be

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,970
a fair bit for make off.

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,250
Let's create a new function called do off.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,390
So we'll create a reference to a function that doesn't exist, do off, and it has no parameters and

19
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,200
we'll check for an error.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,230
We'll do the same thing we do everywhere else, so we'll copy and paste that right there.

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,080
Now let's go make this dual function or at least get started with it.

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,330
And because it's going to be a fairly lengthy bit of code, I'll put it in its own file.

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,450
So in CMD Seelye, we'll create a new file, which I will call off ego.

24
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:44,180
And of course, that has package made and we need a function called due off and it returns potentially

25
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,630
an error.

26
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:54,170
So I'll put return nil here, and let's just think about the kinds of things we're going to need to

27
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,000
do here in this function.

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,690
Well, first of all, before we can have any authentication taking place, we're going to have to have

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,540
our migrations.

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,350
And then we're going to have to after we've done that, you know, will create the migrations.

31
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,670
We'll need to run the migrations and then we'll need to copy some files over and there might be more.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,820
But this isn't a first term.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,520
Well, we already know how to make migrations.

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,490
We had our DV type because we need to know what kind of database the person is using, and we get that

35
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,890
from seld DV data type.

36
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,750
So that gives us our data type, and then we need to create a file name, a based file name for our

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,340
migrations, just like before.

38
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,830
So that would be equal to from the format package.

39
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,050
Sprint F and our format string.

40
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:45,920
And that's going to consist of the Unix time, which is return is it isn't and then create users or

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,720
create off tables or tables like that because there's more than one table being created.

42
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,740
And we substitute, of course, time dot now

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,760
dot Unix Micro.

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,240
So that gives us our base file name.

45
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,510
Now we'll create our up file full path to the up.

46
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,640
We're going to create and that will be equal to sell dot root path

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,240
plus slash migrations plus file name plus.

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,950
And then we'll put up Dot sequel at the end and we'll duplicate that.

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,710
I will make this one downfall.

50
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,100
I make this down.

51
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,070
OK.

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,380
Looks like there's an error there somewhere.

53
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,690
Let's just make sure there's no error.

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,730
I'll just put a long dot print line and use the variables variables I'm not using.

55
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,810
So give me type of file and downfall.

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,980
Yeah, there is no error.

57
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,390
OK, so that'll go away in a minute.

58
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,440
But I'll leave that that here, just so we don't have any errors while I'm writing the rest of the code.

59
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,760
So now we need to copy the upper up migration and we can do that using that function copy file from

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,510
template.

61
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,210
And just handed the name of the template we want, which doesn't exist yet, so we'll have to copy it

62
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:18,840
in there in a minute.

63
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,270
Templates it'll be our file system that we're using.

64
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:35,000
Slashed migrations, and we'll call that one stay off tables, dot plus de B-type, because I have to

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,870
have one for my school, one for post-cruise dot sequel.

66
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,290
And that will be up for OK.

67
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,120
And we'll check for an error

68
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,690
if error is not equal to nil, we'll just exit gracefully with the error.

69
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,140
And now we need to create a down migration.

70
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,960
OK, so that when I can actually just write the code for it right here because it's very simple.

71
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,100
So I'll check for an error.

72
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,330
And of course, I don't use the assignment operator because I already have an error.

73
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:21,870
And we'll say copy data to file, and the data will be a slice of bytes and I'll I have to put in here

74
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,730
is drop table.

75
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:33,420
If exists, users cascade and that will delete the user's table and everything else, that depends upon

76
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,530
it because we're cascading it and we hand it down.

77
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:37,860
File.

78
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,420
Yeah.

79
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,190
And again, we check for an error.

80
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,600
So copy

81
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,220
and paste and the next step is to actually run the migrations.

82
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,530
So to make that happen, I might be able just to call do my great right here and hand it the necessary

83
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,070
arguments.

84
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,890
And of course, the arguments I want to hand out are pretty straightforward.

85
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,960
I want to run up and nothing.

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,150
And that does return an error.

87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
So error equals you migrate.

88
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,230
And again, copy this and paste it there.

89
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,140
And let's just look at this and think of what we're doing right now.

90
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,210
So we're creating our migrations, and I'm pretty sure this is right because that's exactly the syntax

91
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:28,020
we use before we do have to make the create off tables template that we're referring to down here.

92
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,040
But this should work.

93
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,520
All right.

94
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,470
Then we'll get our migration, our template and put one in for Postgres and then later on one for my

95
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,040
school.

96
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,880
Then we copy that data over and make the necessary up migration.

97
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:48,480
Then we copy the this string of bytes over to down migration, and then we run the migrations that should

98
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,780
work.

99
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,690
So let's create a file in templates.

100
00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:01,230
Migrations create a new file that's inside the CMG Seelye folder, and I want to call this one off.

101
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,900
Underscore tables dot postgres dot SQL.

102
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:15,420
OK, now I've already copied to my clipboard the contents of the school file we use to make those tables

103
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,560
so just pasted in here.

104
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,190
OK.

105
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,350
And that should be the one appropriate for Postgres, and we have our IDE.

106
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,130
Firstly, my name and make sure I got the right one here.

107
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,530
I want to go all the way down to tokens and make sure I have token in there.

108
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:28,750
Yeah.

109
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,320
This is the right one because I added my token character.

110
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,450
OK, so if that SQL is right, then in theory this should work.

111
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,090
OK.

112
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,900
We haven't done the copy files over a part yet, but we can test this.

113
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,520
So what we'll do in the next lecture is delete the three tables that are in our database or all the

114
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,680
tables from our database.

115
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,850
Make sure the migrations folder is empty.

116
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,150
Rebuild the Seelye and then run it and see if we get the necessary tables created, which will be a

117
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,930
good first step.
