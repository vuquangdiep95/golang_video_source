1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,030
So we have our middleware written, and now, of course, we need to update our command line tool to

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,210
install that middleware when someone types make off.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:17,020
So we have our off token middleware here and we have our off middleware here in my app and we have a

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,230
warning, OK, I can do that.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,070
He wants me to use this constant instead of hard coding for a one which is fine, we can do that.

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,220
So now let's switch back to our celebrities project, and I'm looking at off.

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,160
Don't go.

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:40,660
And we're at this point here where we want to now the very end of this before the return statement copy

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,920
over middleware.

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,480
And not surprisingly, it's pretty much the same as what we've done here.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,000
And again, we're going to have to create those templates.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,710
But let's get this going first.

13
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:57,070
We're going to copy copy file from template inside of the Templates directory, which is our Read-Only

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,300
embedded file system.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:08,710
And we'll make this middleware and we'll copy over auth don't go text to in the application in my app.

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,290
Middleware often go.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:23,410
And of course, we can copy this and scroll up a bit and paste it here and make this auth dash token

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,390
go and make this our Dash token go.

19
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,060
So now, of course, we need to come over to our Templates directory and create a new folder called

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,570
middleware.

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,230
And inside of the middleware folder, we'll create a new file called Auth Go.

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,920
And another one of Dash Token Go text.

23
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,290
So we're looking at off Dash token.

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,200
So let's switch over to my app and find off a token here.

25
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:07,660
Select and copy and paste it in here, and then we'll open off, go to text and switch back to my app

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,310
and get off and go to text.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,810
I think I might get those backwards.

28
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,360
Let's make sure I often do that off token.

29
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,770
Yeah, I got them backwards.

30
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,020
So we'll copy off token.

31
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,730
Good thing.

32
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,900
I noticed that and paste this into off dash token.

33
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,500
Don't go.

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,250
That's better.

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,650
And now we'll open off doggo

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,460
and go back here and open, often go to text and paste it in.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,730
So that actually should work.

38
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,520
So if you think it through, we should be able to go back to our original Darcy line.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,040
Go back to our map project.

40
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,090
Delete the models related to authentication from the data directory.

41
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,990
Delete the middleware from the middleware directory, but leave middleware.

42
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,830
Don't go.

43
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,390
That'll be part of the actual empty application and delete all the database tables run.

44
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,840
Make auth and everything should be recreated from scratch, which should be pretty straightforward if

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,140
we didn't make any mistakes and we'll try that in the next lecture.
