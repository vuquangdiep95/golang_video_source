1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,810
So we have make Handler working pretty well and is pretty simple, but it will make life easier for

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,570
people using the celebrity's package and this time around.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:16,340
I'm back in Mexico in the CMT Seelye folder of the Celebrity House project, and this time around I

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:23,690
want to work on allowing us to make models case model so someone types celebrities make model and it

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,460
will actually make a model for them.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:33,080
Now, the convention we've used so far is that database table names would be plural, but model names

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,870
are singular.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,410
So, for example, the database for users the table in the database is called users plural, and the

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,720
one for tokens is called tokens plural.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,290
But the actual models in the data folder are called user and token, and we'll follow that same convention

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,250
where we make models.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,790
Now, of course, making a word plural is actually not as simple as you might think, because sometimes

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,630
it's easy.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,490
Sometimes it's ISIS, sometimes it's s.

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,990
But fortunately, there's a little package, a really straightforward one found here at GitHub dot com

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,030
slash g e r t d slash go dash plurals.

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,620
And this is a part of a nice JavaScript package that solves that problem for us.

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,850
So we're going to use that.

19
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,530
So we'll go back to my I.D. Make sure I'm in the celebrities project.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,150
I am an open terminal window and type go get.

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,130
And then that's the URL.

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,000
So it will go and get that for us, and that will just make our lives a lot easier.

23
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,790
So I'll close my terminal and I'll get started.

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,340
So the first thing we want to do, of course, is pretty much the same thing we did when we created

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,880
a handler.

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,380
And that is to make sure that Argument three is there, that they're giving the model a name because

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,820
we can't actually read minds.

28
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,160
So I'll paste that in here and say, you must give the model a name.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:01,790
And assuming we get that again, we want to do this sort of thing that we did before, and that is to

30
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,400
create a data variable and look for an error.

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,740
And actually, we can just copy this whole thing.

32
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,510
There's no point in reinventing the wheel.

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:16,700
We'll just copy this and paste it here and change this from templates handlers handler.

34
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,990
Don't go to text to template data and we'll call it model.

35
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,630
Don't go.

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,250
OK.

37
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,340
So once we've read that again, we'll create a temporary variable string variable, which I'll call

38
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,510
model.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,600
And that will be the data bytes, which is a slice of bytes cast to a string.

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,150
And then I'm going to plurals that I'm going to get a plural version of this.

41
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,290
So I'll just call plumber.

42
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,520
That's my variable name.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,290
Not a real word, but it'll work for my purposes, and I'm going to call the Plurals Package.

44
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,910
We just installed plural lies and found it.

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,950
That's good, and I want a new client.

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,540
And this is right in the documentation for that page, but it's danceable.

47
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,990
So I'll create a variable, which I'm going to call modeling, and that will be equal to R3.

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,610
And I'll create another variable, which I'll call table name or table name is we need both of these

49
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,000
things.

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,410
And again, that's earned three.

51
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,400
And then I'll just work on them.

52
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,840
I'll make them what they need to be.

53
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,020
So the first thing I'll check is to see, did they type in a pluralist name already?

54
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,060
So if plural, which is that client I just created for the plural plurals package?

55
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,170
Is it plural?

56
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,810
Is plural and I handed out three or three.

57
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,810
If it is plural, then modeling.

58
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,670
Model name is equal to plural, singular.

59
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,370
Three.

60
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,740
And table name is equal to strings to lower.

61
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,250
We want it all to be lowercase tabling

62
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,450
otherwise.

63
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,240
In the case where what they typed as ERG three is not plural, then tabling

64
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:30,180
is equal to strings to lower plural, plural part three.

65
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,390
And this will give us our two variables are variables model, name and table name.

66
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,620
In the format that we need them to be now, let's keep going.

67
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,860
Let's build a filing filing.

68
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,260
This is where we're going to write the final file.

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,520
It goes to sell dot root path

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,200
plus slashing data slash plus.

71
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,800
Strings to lower name plus dot.

72
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,400
That's what we'll write the final version of this, OK?

73
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,270
And now of course, we need to work on the final version of the data that we're writing to that file,

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,880
and we're doing that with the string model, OK, that we declared right up there in Line 77.

75
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,580
That's going to be equal to.

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,070
And again, we're going to do a search and replace, but we're going to search for two things strings

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,090
don't replace all.

78
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:34,520
And we're working with model and we're going to look for the string that'll be in our template model

79
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,940
name.

80
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,520
Dollar sign modeling, dollar sign.

81
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,400
And we're going to replace every occurrence of that using the staircase package we installed last time

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,800
around.

83
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,230
And we want it to count.

84
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,920
And again, it's going to be model name.

85
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:49,880
OK.

86
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,450
So that's the first thing we want to replace.

87
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,050
And of course, that's the name of the model.

88
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:01,370
Now I'll duplicate this whole line, and this time I'm looking for table nine door sign table name.

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,260
I get that right.

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,850
Tamboli and Amit.

91
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,030
Yep, and here I'm going to use just table name.

92
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,080
And of course, that's the function that returns the name of the table.

93
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,450
And I have an extra parentheses there.

94
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,510
OK, so we have that the next step is just a copy data to file.

95
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:35,120
So I can say error equals copy data to file and I'm going to use a slice of bytes and I'm going to hand

96
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,640
it model that string we just worked on.

97
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:46,400
And we're writing into filing and we'll check for air, you know, just copy this error checking code

98
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,870
right here because it's exactly the same and paste it in there.

99
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,090
OK, so that's a good start.

100
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,730
Now, of course, we need to actually put a file named the one we're reading here.

101
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,760
Templates data model, don't go to text.

102
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,720
So let's open that up.

103
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:12,760
Could a new file and we're going to call it Model Dot Go Dot T s t.

104
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,380
Now, just to save some time on the course resources for this lecture, you'll find a file called Model

105
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,370
Dot Gokey.

106
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,450
Because what we're putting in here, there's nothing new.

107
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,820
It's exactly the sort of thing we've done already, but we'll go through it quickly anyway.

108
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,900
So I'll paste in the contents of that file at the very top.

109
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,130
Of course, it's packaged data.

110
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,130
We have our standard imports and here is where we're going to give the model its actual length.

111
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,460
So that's why we went to all that trouble of using camel case and plurals and so forth.

112
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,280
And we're going to say that the stub model has only three fields I've created and updated that.

113
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,650
Then we have our table function, and that's where we substitute model name here and table name here,

114
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,090
and everything else is pretty standard.

115
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:06,230
We put in a starter, get all a get by ID, an update record or update method, delete method and insert

116
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,680
method.

117
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,100
And then down here just to show them how they can use builder.

118
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,600
I put an example of how you can use uppers sequel builder.

119
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:14,990
OK.

120
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,050
That's a good starting point, and they can modify it to their heart's content.

121
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,320
So at this point, I should be able to open my terminal window.

122
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,240
Make sure I have everything right.

123
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,020
I'll type, make build, underscore Sealord.

124
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,430
And then I should be able to switch to my My App project, which should have the new build of celebrities

125
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:36,880
in there.

126
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,300
And if I look in my data directory, I don't have anything called test.

127
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,530
So let's just try this out.

128
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,750
Dot slash celebrities make model and I call it test, and it said it finished.

129
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,810
And if we look up here in our data model, we have a test.

130
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,490
Don't go.

131
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,760
It does look like there's an error.

132
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,510
And of course, it's the FMT package.

133
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,040
Apparently, I have that left in there.

134
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,590
There's no problem.

135
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,120
If I delete that, does it fix it?

136
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,620
We have an error down here.

137
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,630
Get Insert I.D..

138
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,030
And of course, that's an uppercase D like that.

139
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,370
So let's go fix those two things in our test model back over here.

140
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,820
So the first thing up here is get rid of the format package and then look for get insert.

141
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,880
There it is, and this will be fixed on the copy.

142
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,300
I posted the course website for you, but I had to fix it right here and that should take care of it.

143
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:31,870
OK.

144
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,050
So if I rebuild this now, make build seal.

145
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:46,560
And switch back to my app and close this test, go and delete Tesco and run it again, this time it

146
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,050
should work.

147
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,560
Make model test.

148
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,560
So it made a model, let's go look at it.

149
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:59,770
There's Tesco and the model name is Test Singular Perfect.

150
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,280
The table it's returning is tests plural perfect?

151
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,170
Everything looks good here.

152
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,630
OK.

153
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,170
And that will make life much easier for our end users.

154
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,820
All right, let's move on.
