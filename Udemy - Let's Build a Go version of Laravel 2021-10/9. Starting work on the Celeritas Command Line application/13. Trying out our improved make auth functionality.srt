1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,700
So we're just about ready to try the new make out functionality.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,770
And before we do that, I did have one typographical error, which I'm sure you noticed over here in

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,820
the middleware folder inside of the Templates folder in CMD Seelye.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,780
I have t.x t at the end of this instead of dark text.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,810
So let's fix that.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,930
Otherwise, we're just going to have a an error.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,330
So that becomes dark text.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:31,400
OK, now let's go down to our terminal and let's make build, underscore Seelye to build the new binary

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,980
and copy it where it has to go.

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,650
And that's done.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,800
And now let's switch over to my app, and let's make sure we get rid of the things that we don't want

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,130
here.

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,600
So I don't want models.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,010
No, I do want models.

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,540
Don't go.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,560
I don't want token, don't go or user don't go in the data directory and you might want to just move

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,160
those somewhere.

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,880
But I have lots of copies, so I'm going to delete those moved to trash.

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,110
I want to make sure my middleware folder is almost empty.

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,030
It doesn't have both token or off go.

21
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,040
So let's delete those and I'm going to get errors because I, my other code, is referring to things

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,060
that no longer exist.

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,000
But that's OK in my migrations.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,090
I want to make sure there's nothing in here, so delete those.

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,430
And now I want to go to my database and make sure that my tables are all gone.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:29,860
So back to post Taco and I mean, toss in the celebrity stalker salacious, select all of these tables

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,700
and delete them.

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,160
Cascaded delete.

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:37,870
And they're gone.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,850
So at this point, I should be able to Typekit slash celebrities in the makeup project make off.

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,720
And it finished.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,810
OK, so let's make sure everything is there, we have our this should be the same because I didn't change,

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,650
so user don't go, that's fine in the data directory token.

34
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,780
Don't go, that's fine in the data directory and in my middleware, I now have off token.

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,030
Let's make sure it's the right one.

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,030
It is, and I have off.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,540
Don't go.

38
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,760
And that's correct, too.

39
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:11,770
OK.

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,470
Is there anything else we should add there?

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,210
Because if you think it through when they actually run, make off, we're not telling them anything.

42
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,110
We're not telling them what we did and we're not telling them things like, for example, you probably

43
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,480
want to go to your models dog go folder and add these two lines right here because we don't want to

44
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,590
do that programmatically.

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,050
We probably could, but the chance of messing up somebody's existing code is too high, and I'd rather

46
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,440
just tell the users, you know, this is kind of your responsibility.

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,080
If you want to have access to the users and tokens in the model struct, just go add them, add them

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,990
there and of course, add them down here as well.

49
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,160
So let's go back to our celebrities project and let's find that often go, which isn't the middleware

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,290
in this case, is the commander installs the authentication tables and all of those things.

51
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,410
Let's just put some messages here.

52
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,570
I'll put color yellow just so it's visible, and I'll put a, you know, as a string a couple of spaces,

53
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:21,540
then a hyphen, then users tokens and remember tokens, migrations created and executed.

54
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,420
Just let them know that we've built the necessary tables in the database and executed and on duplicate

55
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:27,690
that.

56
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,410
And I'll also I'll change this message to.

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,760
User and token models created.

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,580
I don't duplicate that and change this one to off middleware created.

59
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,460
Then I'll just give them a blank line colored yellow and a blank line, and I'll duplicate that one

60
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,770
more time and I'll put the reminder here.

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't forget to add user and token models in data slash models.

62
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,010
Don't go.

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:23,080
And to add appropriate middleware to your roots, and I'll put an exclamation there.

64
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,490
That's just a little friendlier.

65
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,090
OK.

66
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,250
So that seems to work pretty well.

67
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,880
Now, obviously, there's more we can do with our command line tool.

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:39,520
For example, we can automate creating an empty or a stub model file or a stub middleware file or a

69
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,540
stub handler.

70
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,470
So let's get started on doing those things in the next couple of lectures.
