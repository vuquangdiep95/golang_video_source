1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,250
So we've written all the code that should execute migrations.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's give it a try.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,730
So I'm still in this alert house project and I have a terminal window open, so I'll make sure I'm at

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,620
the root level of my celebrity house project.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,190
I am.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,500
So now I can run, make, build, underscore seal art and that will build a new version of the command

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,290
line executable and copy it to this project.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:22,550
My app.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,210
So I have a new version of silver here.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,310
So let's just look at how things are before we try anything.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:33,260
Right now, I have nothing in my migrations folder and I'm connected to my database and make sure you

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,100
have your Docker images running before you do the next step or nothing will work.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,850
And I'm looking at my celebrity's database in the Docker image, and right now I just have three tables

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,480
the ones that we created last time around.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,890
So I'm going to generate a migration dot slash celebrities and it's make migration and it requires a

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,170
name, but just leave the name out and see what happens.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,850
Error you must give your migration a name perfect.

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,180
So happy apparel, and I'll call this one test and that should.

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,400
And it did create an app migration.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,470
So let's open that and of course, is not going to do anything if we try to run this until we uncomment

21
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:09,980
this bit.

22
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:16,930
So one comment that I'll leave these ones here commented, But I'll uncomment this.

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,350
I don't have to because I already have this trigger, but it should create or replace it.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,290
And finally, I'll create the trigger.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,740
So these lines, from 10 to 16 create or replace the function trigger set timestamp.

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,450
And this one assigns a trigger to this table using this function.

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,030
OK.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,570
So we also want to, of course, uncomment are down migration.

29
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,820
So I'll uncomment that

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,040
perfect.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,710
Now I should be able to come down here.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,230
Clear the screen and type dot slash celebrities migrate up.

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,070
And it says it ran.

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,960
Let's go look at the database and make sure that it did.

35
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,940
So back to my database client.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,750
I'll refresh it and look, it created some table.

37
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,280
Let's make sure it has the right columns.

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:14,770
So the structure of that is ID of integer, which is a sequence some field, which is a marker 255 and

39
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,790
are two time stamps.

40
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,390
Perfect.

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,370
So now we'll go back to the top level of this database, and you notice it also created this schema

42
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,910
migration's table, which if it doesn't exist the first time the tool is run, it creates that for us.

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,840
And that's what keeps track of which migrations have been run and which ones have not, and so on and

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,290
so forth.

45
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,020
Let's try running the down migration.

46
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,190
Migrate down.

47
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,560
And it says it finished.

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,670
So let's go back and look, refresh this and it's gone.

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,010
But it did leave the schema migrations table, which it should, of course.

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,530
OK, so that all seems to work pretty well.

51
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,620
Now, of course, there's one thing I need to do if I go back here and just type in the terminal in

52
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:04,480
my Maya project dot slash celebrities and hit return, it prints out the help, but it actually doesn't

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,210
put our migrate commands or anything else in there.

54
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,260
So let's go fix that.

55
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:15,490
Let's go back to our celebrities project, and let's find out where that show help exists.

56
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,710
So right now, show help.

57
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,310
There it is.

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,020
Command.

59
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,850
Click on that or control.

60
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,880
Click if you're in windows to see where that function exists.

61
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,690
So it exists in my mind, I'd go, Oh, I'm going to get it out of there.

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,100
I don't want it to be there.

63
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,530
So cut that out of there.

64
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,290
And instead, I'll put it in my helper smile.

65
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,920
I think that's a better place for it.

66
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,590
So I'll put it right at the bottom of that file.

67
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,800
And now let's updating.

68
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,120
And of course, we need to update color use color.

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,990
So see if it'll do the auto import for me.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,380
Colored yellow?

71
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,550
Perfect.

72
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,420
That should fix the import, and I'll just delete the extraneous code.

73
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,910
And back in Maine, let's make sure that color is not being used anywhere else.

74
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,650
It so that's fine.

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,210
OK, so back to my helper stuck up.

76
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,850
Let's update our help file.

77
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,820
First of all, I'll put a blank line in there because it just looks bad.

78
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,520
So we're now going to add the command, migration and space over.

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not going to use tabs because they often don't work when you're working with console, but it's

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,480
up to you.

81
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:26,740
And I'll say migrate runs all of the migrations that have not been run previously

82
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,840
and I'll say migrate down

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,310
runs, reverses the most previous.

84
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:50,160
Our most recent, most recent migration, and we can try to migrate reset, which we haven't tried yet,

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,360
but we'll do it before too long.

86
00:04:51,780 --> 00:05:04,020
This one runs all down migrations in reverse order and then all up migrations.

87
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,060
OK.

88
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:16,490
And we also should say make the migration name and we better space this over, or it will be very attractive.

89
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:40,720
And here will say creates two new up and down migrations in the migrations

90
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,000
folder.

91
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,190
I think that's it for now.

92
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,690
So we'll save this and I'll just rebuild the seal I.

93
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,670
Then I'll switch to my app.

94
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,060
Clear the terminal console and just run celebrities.

95
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,140
And we still have that Air Command required twice, but I can live with that for now, we'll clean that

96
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,710
up later on.

97
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:15,730
The help file at least seems to be useful, and let's try that slash celebrity's version application

98
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,070
version 1.0 point 0.0.

99
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,680
Oh, perfect.

100
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,600
So this seems to work really well.

101
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:26,860
Now let's take advantage of the code we've written and actually create a new command make off.

102
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,240
And what that would will do is copy all of the necessary files from our command line, from our read

103
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,190
only file system in our command command line application over to the appropriate location in the My

104
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:48,430
App application, and it will also create and run migrations to create these tables, the ones that

105
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,520
we did by hand right over here.

106
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,760
So remember, tokens, tokens and users will automatically create all of that.

107
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,780
Now that might take a couple of steps, but we'll get started on it in the next lecture.
