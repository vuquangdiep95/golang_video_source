00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:08,600
So one of the things that makes using a package like Celebrity House or Laravel attractive to many developers

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,270
is the convenience of getting access to certain functions or methods or functionality.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,060
And one of the things that we can say about our application as it exists right now is that it could

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,550
be a little more convenient.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,920
And for example, I'm looking at rootstock go in the my app package and it's little things like this

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,220
in order to get a get request here and line 16.

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:38,570
I have to use the receiver, a and then app and then routes and then get, which doesn't bother me at

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,800
all because I can see at a glance exactly where that get functionality exists in the celebrity's functionality.

9
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,590
Now what we could do is make some convenience or helper methods, so let's try that.

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,760
So right at the root level of my project, because that's where rootstock go exists.

11
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,500
We're going to create a new file called Just Convenience.

12
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:01,940
Don't go.

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,260
OK.

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,660
And of course, that's in Package Me.

15
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:15,130
What I'm going to do is just make some helper functions, so for example, if I want to get a get route,

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,580
I can create a function with the receiver of a pointer to application and I can just call this route

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:29,970
get and I can give it the same parameters that aid our app routes don't get has, which is a string.

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,570
So I'll call it as string.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,110
And then it has an FTP handler func.

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:43,420
So each of type http dot handler func and make sure you get the right one and it doesn't return anything.

21
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:53,380
And I then I just have that call a dot app, dot roots, dot get and hand it s and h my two parameters.

22
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:00,730
So what I do that that means I can go back to rootstock, go and do things like this instead of having

23
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,340
the home page, be a dot app, dot root start.

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,530
Yet I could just make it a dot.

25
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,630
Yeah, and that's a lot shorter, so that's really convenient.

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,710
So of course, we can do the same thing for post.

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,180
So let's go back to convenience store go and create another function.

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:27,180
I can just copy this whole thing and paste it here and change it to post, and this becomes a to start

29
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,640
post.

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,000
And of course, the other thing we do in Roots File is we use middleware.

31
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,490
So let me paste that again and change this to use.

32
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,060
And now it becomes a dot, and of course, it has different parameters.

33
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,010
It doesn't use all of these things.

34
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,230
It uses middleware.

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,830
So M and then we use the same kind of receiver or some kind of parameter signature that the use function

36
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,460
from the chip route uses.

37
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,460
And it uses very attic func HTP dot handler.

38
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,230
And the second parameter is HGTV dog handler, OK?

39
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,950
A weird signature, but that's how it actually appears in the cheap package.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,570
So of course, we're going to now use them.

41
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,470
Dot dot dot.

42
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,120
Because it's very hot.

43
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,100
That's better.

44
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,980
But these aren't used anywhere, which is why I'm getting the warning.

45
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,920
I can go back now to routes and say, change the post one.

46
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,000
So this becomes.

47
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,840
Simply.

48
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,860
A post.

49
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,890
Now that's a small change, but it actually makes for very readable code, and a lot of people prefer

50
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,900
to have one helper function like that.

51
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,210
And really, it's nothing more than an alias to a dot app.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,300
Don't read scanned or aid on app.

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,350
Don't read post.

54
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,640
But a lot of people like it.

55
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,490
So you might want to implement that functionality.

56
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,630
It's entirely up to you.

57
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,920
I'm going to make it available for my users so they can use them if they want to.
