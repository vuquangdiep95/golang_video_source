1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,130
Chances are, if you've worked with go much in the past, you probably already have it installed.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,260
But let's make sure we have the latest version.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,420
So as I record this, the current first result if you search for go or probably go long on your favorite

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,760
search engine, is this page golang dot org?

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,360
And there's a link to this in the course of resources for this lecture.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,400
And in order to download Go.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,140
Not surprisingly, you click this big button and you choose the distribution appropriate for your operating

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,810
system Windows, Mac, Linux.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,610
You can compile from source if you want, but I don't recommend it.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,000
It's a lot of work for no real benefit.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:43,980
Now, if you're on a Mac, this version, the one that you see right here, that's the one for Intel

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,910
based processors.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,160
But if you're on a newer Mac that has the M1 chip Apple Silicon, the one you want is actually this

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,440
one ARM 64, Darwin ARM 64.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,270
So just download that and install it now as I record this.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,170
Go is in the process of making this go dot dev the home page instead.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,300
And when you take this course, this might be what you get when you search for it.

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,830
And again, it is pretty much the same thing.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,350
Click the download button and that will actually download it for your operating system.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,380
But the thing is, if you're on a Mac right now, you're going to get the AMD64 and not the ARM64.

21
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,120
So instead, you might want to click on this more link right here, and then you can.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,020
You're taken back to the same page where we were just looking at.

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,790
And again, if you're on an Intel chip, you download this one.

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,530
And if you're on Apple Silicon, you download the ARM64 down here.

25
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,920
So install that, make sure you have the latest version and let's move on.
