00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,710
So we're also going to need an editor of some sort when we're writing go code and there are lots to

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,290
choose from, and chances are you probably have one.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,560
But just to be safe, if you're looking one, this will do the job.

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:18,500
Visual Studio Code You just code a code visual studio dot com, which is found in the course resources

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,190
for this lecture.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,690
Choose your operating system so you can have Mac, Windows or Linux.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,630
Download it and install it.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,170
And once you have it installed, start it up and I'll just switch to it right now and you're going to

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,120
want to go to the extensions and you go to want to search for go, obviously.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,970
So when you find it, this is the one right here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,610
Rich go language support, install that.

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,230
So click on that, install it.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,110
And once you've installed it, open the command palette, which is shipped Cloverleaf P on a Mac and

14
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,110
shipped command p on Windows by default.

15
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:58,060
This will pop up and look for go install update tools just to make sure that they're all there.

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,560
So select that and click this checkbox to check all of these and click OK.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,970
And when you do that, that little terminal will open down here or the output, and it will show you

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,980
that they're all installing.

19
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,010
Wait for that to finish.

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,650
And when you're done, I always just restart my I.D. just to be safe and then you're good to go.
