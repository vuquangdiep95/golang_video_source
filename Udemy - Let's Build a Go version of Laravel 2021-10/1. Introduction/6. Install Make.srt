1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,400
In this course, I'll be using Make, which is a really good and very commonly used build tool.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,740
And of course, this is optional.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,980
If you don't want to do this, you can just run the software the way that you normally do.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,130
But I highly recommend you install, make and I'll be providing build scripts or make scripts, make

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,160
recipes as they're called as we go on in this course.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,620
So this is the documentation for make itself, and I've put a link to this in the course resources for

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:25,920
this.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,490
And there's a couple of different ways to install it.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,710
But if you were on a Mac far and away, the easiest is to use homebrew and you install homebrew by copying

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,930
this link, pasting it into a terminal window.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,200
And when you've done so, you can install make just by opening your favorite terminal and typing brew

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,550
install make and that will install it for you.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,380
And when you're done, you'll be able to run make right from the command line.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,630
But if you're on windows, it's a little bit different.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,080
And since most people these days are on Windows 10 and some have made it to Windows 11, the equivalent

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,900
of Homebrew for Windows is called chocolatey.

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,580
And you can install that and there's a link to this in the course resources right here.

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,900
The instructions for doing so are pretty straightforward.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,280
And once you've done that, you'll open windows and I'm on a Mac, so I'm going to pretend I'm on windows

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:22,590
right now and you would type choko install Mac and that will install a version of make that is suitable

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,610
for this course.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,370
So go ahead and install make and let's move on.
