1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,530
So we have our Maler package more or less ready to go, and we can't try it until we hook it up to this

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,550
latest project.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,280
And that's where I am right now.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,780
I'm looking at the file celebrities don't go in the celebrities project, and naturally, we want to

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,600
make this mailer functionality available, not just within the celebrities project, but also to any

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,690
project that imports this package or this module.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,510
So naturally, we need to add a feel to our celebrity type right here at the top of this file.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,940
So I'll add one and I'll call it mail and it's a type mailer.

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,280
The package we just created don't.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,050
Mail, and for some reason, it's not importing it, but that's no problem.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,530
We'll just come up here and add it

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,800
there, so I'll save this to format it now once we've done that.

13
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,980
We also want to have a place to store our views for male and we have this views folder and we could

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,460
use that.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,550
But I think that's awkward.

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,250
So I'm going to add another folder here, which is called male, and that's where I'm going to store

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,650
the templates I'll use for sending email.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,450
Now, the next thing we need to do is very similar to what we did in other cases, like when we created

19
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,410
our renderer, we need to add a create mehler function.

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,720
So let's see where we create the renderer right there.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,070
We'll do it right between a right after our create renderer function.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,520
And all we're really doing here is populating the necessary fields in our mailer dot male type.

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,660
So I'll create a function and it will be with receivers, see pointer to celebrities and I'll call this

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,130
create mailer.

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,020
And it takes new parameters and it returns a mailer dot mail.

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,670
Now, if you recall, there's a bunch of things we're specifying in the UN file, and one of those happens

27
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,960
to be the SMTP port that we're going to connect to if we're sending using SMTP.

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,120
But of course, that's going to come in the form of a string.

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,400
So I'll create a big variable called port and I'll ignore the error and it's going to be assigned the

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,630
value of Sturt Con HPI, and I'll simply get that value from the environment as you've already read

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,560
the data on file.

32
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:25,140
So OS don't get OMS and I'm looking for the SMTP underscore port now that I have that in the correct

33
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,680
format.

34
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,350
Let's create a mailer and I'll just call it say for mailer, and that's going to be assigned the value

35
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,460
of the type mailer dot mail.

36
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,420
And we'll populate his fields so domain will be stored.

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,930
Get on.

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,100
Male underscore Delaine, I believe that's what we called it.

39
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,990
And I'll duplicate this a few times and just make changes.

40
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:02,180
So after we get the domain, we want where the template stored templates and that's going to be not

41
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,490
coming from the environment instead.

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,440
It will be Seedat route pass, the route path to our application, my app in our case.

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,810
Plus SGML, the folder that I just created or told it to create when it starts out.

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,110
So we need domain, we need templates, we need to host the mail host, SMTP host.

45
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,010
That's what it's called.

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,860
We also want the port, and in our case, that's port variable we just created.

47
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,110
And we're also going to need the username.

48
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,930
And that will be lost on get on.

49
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:48,920
And we're looking for a SMTP underscore username and the password, which is password.

50
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,180
And we're also going to need encryption where we're using for encryption.

51
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,730
And that's SMTP encryption.

52
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,660
And we're going to want our from name, which is SMTP

53
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,740
from underscore name.

54
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,530
Now it's from underscore name.

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,130
And then the address from address is from address.

56
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,380
And we need our jobs channel, so let's give ourselves some room and we can just make that right here

57
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,520
jobs.

58
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,380
And that will be make a chan of Mailer's message.

59
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,500
And we want to have some maximum size for that.

60
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,740
And I think a good value would be, say, 20.

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,640
OK.

62
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,290
This is not going to be MailChimp, we're not going to be sending millions of e-mails using this.

63
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,690
So Tony is going to allow us to send lots and lots of mail very quickly and we need a results channel

64
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,340
and that will be make Chan of type mailer results.

65
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,020
And again, we'll set it to 20.

66
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:27,770
OK.

67
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,350
And we also want our API values.

68
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,160
And that would be OK.

69
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,160
Start, get on.

70
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:41,900
And we're looking for Maler underscore API and we have two more one two.

71
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,860
So API key is Maler underscore key.

72
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,440
And the last one is API.

73
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:53,810
You are.

74
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,860
And that is the Mehler underscore the URL.

75
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,280
OK.

76
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,160
So we've set up the necessary fields now.

77
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,890
We just return that value return and.

78
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,730
And now, if we go up to where we're populating our celebrities values right here.

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,590
We can just stick it in here, see Doug Mailer for Male is equal to see Dot Create Mailer.

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,180
And that should populate that value for us.

81
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,410
OK, so the last thing we're going to have to do, of course, is to start the mail channel, to start

82
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,890
the listening and we'll do that right at the end of the new function.

83
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,040
So after we create the renderer, we can just call and we'll use the keyword go to make this run in

84
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,790
the background.

85
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,240
See Dot Mail right there.

86
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,940
Don't listen for.

87
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,030
And that should start it running in the background.

88
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,600
OK, so let's try compiling our actual application and make sure it actually starts.

89
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,640
So I'll switch over to my app and open a terminal window and I'll type of make stop in case it's running.

90
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,520
It's not so clear the screen may start, and it should at least compile.

91
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,990
We can't send mail yet because we haven't specified anything in the dot on the file, but it should

92
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,650
at least start.

93
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,900
OK, so we've actually started that's good in the next lecture, we'll set up a test mail server and

94
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,640
you can use whatever email server you want to, of course, and try it out and see if it actually works.
