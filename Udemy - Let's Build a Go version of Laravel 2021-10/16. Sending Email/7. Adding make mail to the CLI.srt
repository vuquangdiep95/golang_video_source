1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,360
So this time around, we want to improve our celebrities command line application to make it easy for

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,370
people to generate email templates.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,440
In other words, they open up a terminal switch to the directory where their application is and just

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,030
type Solaris house make mail with some kind of name for their template.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,950
And of course, we do that in this Alatas project.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,010
So let's go to our CMG folder, then the Seelye folder and open up main account.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,540
And of course, the main function here is where we determine what to do.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,780
And if you're down to Line 41, my code when they type, make I fire off request to this function,

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,410
do Nick.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,530
So if I open that, that's in the file mate, don't go and I'll have to do is scroll down and find a

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,850
spot to add mail.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,660
So I'll put it right here.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,090
Case

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,290
Map.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,930
And of course, that's going to require are three.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,910
So I'll make sure that only three exists.

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,680
If our three is equal to an empty string, then exit gracefully with a message, a new error.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,520
Errors start new and I'll say you must.

19
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,020
That has to be a string.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,360
You must give the email template a name or whatever you want in there, of course.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,700
But if they get past that, then really all we need to do is to open templates for our templates, which

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,410
sounds kind of weird, but you know what I mean?

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:36,240
A starter template for HTML Doc Team Temple and a starter template for playing dot template and copy

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,750
those over.

25
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,440
OK.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,550
So what I'm going to do is assume that those exist and they don't, but they will.

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:51,090
Before too long, I'll say HTML mail is assigned the value of cel dot root path plus slash mail, and

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,850
I know that folder exists because I created that startup.

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:04,560
Plus that'll take our three convert to lowercase strings dot to lower our own three plus, and I'll

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
have it end with Dot h html template.

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,370
Then I'll duplicate this line and change the variable name to plain mail.

32
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,300
Try that again.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:27,300
Plain now mail and this one becomes plain oatmeal, so that'll be the the targets where we're putting

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,350
the final files.

35
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,120
Now I'll copy file from template,

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,790
from template, and I want to copy it from.

37
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,790
This doesn't exist yet, but it will in a few minutes, templates on a Read-Only embedded file system,

38
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,160
mailer mail dot html dot tempo.

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:03:00,540
And I'm copying that to my mail and I'll check for an error if error is not equal to nil and exit gracefully

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,220
with the error.

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,430
Now I'll copy this whole thing.

42
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,050
Give myself a little more room.

43
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,860
Paste it in here.

44
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:19,840
Make this an equals instead of an assignment operator, and I'm going to copy plane mail from mail not

45
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,840
playing dot template.

46
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,570
And that should be all I have to do there.

47
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,030
So now let's go to our Templates folder and create a new folder.

48
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:39,540
Inside of that, a new folder called Maler, which is what I specified here when I reference the templates

49
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,530
creating new files, new file mail dot html template.

50
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:57,900
And another new file mailed a plane called Temple, and I will go to the actual mail templates that

51
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,250
I'm using in my other application and copy those kind of you can put whatever you want in there.

52
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,890
So here's the one for HTML, a copy that switch back to my celebrity's project.

53
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:16,650
Make sure I'm looking at the correct file I am pasting back to my app, open test playing, copy the

54
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,110
contents and put it in the plane template and paste that.

55
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:30,060
Then the only other thing to do is to open our help and update that so show help is the function is

56
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,220
called right from here in main dgo.

57
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,240
So I'll go command, click on it and I'll say make mail, make mail.

58
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,470
And then some name

59
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,380
creates two starter mail templates in the Mail Directory.

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,240
So at this point, I should be able to clear my terminal.

61
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,240
Make sure I'm at the root level of my this project.

62
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,750
I am.

63
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,930
And I'll say, make build, underscore Clia, and that should build the command line interface.

64
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,070
Copy it over to my other project, so I'll switch to my other project.

65
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,810
Open a terminal.

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,830
Clear the screen.

67
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,780
I'm in the correct directory.

68
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,950
Yes, I'm at the root level of my app, so I should be able to Typekit celebrities make mail and I already

69
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,160
have one called test, so I'll call this one doesn't matter what I use.

70
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,340
Yellow is another.

71
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,970
So let's look at yellow HTML template.

72
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,600
That's an HTML template and yellow plain, and it's all set to go perfect.

73
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,070
Well, that's just a little touch, but it makes life easier for the developer and speeds up the workflow.

74
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,410
And of course, if you're using this for code that you can reuse for projects, you would obviously

75
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,900
make those starter templates a little more sophisticated than I have, but it's entirely up to you.

76
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:59,640
For example, in the HTML, my starter template might be using one of the CC frameworks that are specifically

77
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
for email, and that's perfectly fine.

78
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,530
And if you want to do that, more power to you.

79
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,470
But I just want to make sure that we know how to send email and I'll leave the refinements of the actual

80
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,690
message and formatting of the message to you.

81
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,100
Let's move on.
