1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,110
So let's try sending some email using an API, and as I suggested last time around, I will be using

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,030
Mail Gun because I have an account there.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,610
And again, you may want to try this out and if so, feel free to do it.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,270
But if you do so, bear in mind that you're probably going to have to pay a little bit of money to male

5
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,310
gun or SendGrid or Spark Post or whichever service you choose to try it.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,670
But in any case, I'm going to use Milka.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,650
Now, obviously, when I send through a mail gun, it's not going to wind up in my mail hog or my test

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,490
email server.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:39,050
So instead of having to use a real email address and I'm going to use info at the really incom that

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:44,840
happens to be the domain or one of the domains that I have live on mail gun and I'm going to send it

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,890
to myself.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,960
So I'll send it to my Gmail account

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,180
and I'll say test subject sent using an API.

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,280
OK, my template is still test.

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,660
Everything else stays the same.

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:08,720
Now what I can do is comment this one out, uncomment this one and send it to the channel.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,070
And once I go and make the appropriate changes my own file, it will by default send it using an API.

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,230
Because remember when we set up our mail package, we actually checked to see if there are values in

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,960
the appropriate entries in the data on file for an API and if they are, if they exist, that's how

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,650
we send them out.

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,300
So I should have to make no other changes here, but I do have to make a change in my dance.

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,910
And you'll notice right here we have our email settings and I have this entry SMTP from.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,960
And it turns out that's not what I'm using.

24
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,550
So you can delete that entirely.

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,970
What we have instead is from name and from address and the other one that I didn't bother putting in

26
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,190
last time around because when we're using a real mail server was mail, underscored domain.

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,870
But it turns out we actually need that.

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,290
OK.

29
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,620
So those changes have to be made.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,200
And the other thing you're going to want to do is to populate these values.

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,000
Now I set mine up for Mail Gun and don't bother trying to use this key because I'm going to regenerate

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,730
it as soon as this lecture is over, so it'll be a different one.

33
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,510
Now these values, of course, these two mail key and mailer you Earl, they're specific to whatever

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,380
API service you're using, for example, on Mail Gun.

35
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,430
I use this URL because I set up my account in North America, but if I did it in Asia or my mail is

36
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,290
being sent from Asia, it's a different you are and different providers have different URLs, but just

37
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,200
consult their documentation to find out the one appropriate for you.

38
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,550
Now that I've made these changes OK, and I set the domain here to what I use on Mail Gun, and it's

39
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,650
not the bare domain name for Mail Gun.

40
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,560
I happen to use Imgur really incom because I wanted to use Mail Gun for sending, but have a different

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,810
server for receiving.

42
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,470
So whatever your value is for the domain setting for mail gun, if that's the one you're using, make

43
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,670
sure you duplicate it there.

44
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,570
Exactly well, this just won't work.

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:12,800
So now I should be able to open my terminal and say, make restart the one that's happening.

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm going to switch to my web browser and look at the log file for Mail Go.

47
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,820
So you can see right here in this log file that the most recent set one was at 20 21 09 29.

48
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,850
Other words, September the 29th at 12:25.

49
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:36,620
OK, now I'm going to switch back to my other browser window and I'm looking at localhost column 4000

50
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:43,550
Test Dash Mail, and if I just click Return here, hit return, it should send that message.

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,740
So let's go back and look at our log file.

52
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,580
And I'll refresh this.

53
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,680
And there it is, 14, 29, it actually sent it.

54
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,730
It was delivered.

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,210
So that seems to work really well.

56
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,810
OK.

57
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,090
And that was relatively painless.

58
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,320
Now there's one other thing I want to do, and we'll take care of that in the next lecture.

59
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,620
And it has to do with these mail templates.

60
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,920
It seems to me that if you're sending e-mail, it might be really convenient if we were to add an option

61
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,590
to our celebrity voice command line application.

62
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,320
That said, you know, make mail with some name and it automatically generates two stub templates.

63
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,600
Read in the appropriate folder for the application, and I want you to save our users some time.

64
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,990
So we'll take care of that, and it's really easy in the next election.
