1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:06,770
So now that we've put all this work into password resets and things like that, let's make sure our

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,020
command line applications celebrities in the Celebrity House project is updated to take advantage of

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,680
that sort of thing.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,140
So what I'm going to do is switch to my desktop and I have two windows open here.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,800
On the left hand side is my app that has the latest versions of everything I need.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,620
And on the right hand side is hilarious and I need to copy things over here.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,090
So let's get started.

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,300
First of all, we're going to need the mail templates.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,870
The password reset stuff, and that's inside the mail folder.

10
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:47,060
So these two files I'll copy over to the CMD folder, insularity, tasks and then Seelye and then templates

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,190
inside of Mailer.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,250
So I'll copy them in there.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:01,790
And I also need the handlers so that inside the handlers folder, the art handlers, and I'm going to

14
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,670
copy that to the Handlers folder inside the Templates folder.

15
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:16,340
And I also need my forgot and reset templates, and those are inside views, so I have forgot right

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,900
here and I have reset password both jet files.

17
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,370
They get copied to the Views folder in templates.

18
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,320
I don't have one now, so I'll create one.

19
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:36,830
So inside of templates create a new folder called views, and I'll copy these two over to the Views

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,250
folder.

21
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,500
Now, go back up one level.

22
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,740
Now I need to copy my middleware for remember token.

23
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,290
And see what we have in center middleware right now.

24
00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:02,000
We have off token and off, so I won't remember a copy that in there and then insert our data folder.

25
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,530
We'll have to copy the Remember token over so data.

26
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,630
And remember token.

27
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,890
And I'll put a text at the end of that as well.

28
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:36,050
OK, so all those files are copied over now, you can see I have a few errors here, so I'm going to

29
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:43,220
refactor this and rename it to remember, don't go to text just to and get rid of those errors because

30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,150
these are just templates.

31
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:51,830
They don't get compiled and rename that one to go to next.

32
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,500
OK.

33
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,120
So I think I have all the necessary files copied over to my templates.

34
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:07,040
Now, obviously, we're working with off don't go in the CMD Seelye folder, and so far we're copying

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:15,560
over or we're doing the migrations and then we run the migrations and then we copy user and token over

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,970
to a data folder.

37
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,750
So I'm going to copy this and we're going to have to copy over.

38
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,700
I remember one which is called Remember Underscore token logo.

39
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,110
So remember?

40
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,170
Underscore token, go to text to data.

41
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,620
And I want to call it remember underscore token, there's that one.

42
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,520
Now let's look at our middleware in our middleware folder.

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,550
We now have remember underscore or go dot.

44
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,350
We need to copy that over.

45
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,040
So copy this and paste it here.

46
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,070
And we want to call this.

47
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,410
Remember, don't go to text to

48
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,160
remember ago MBA.

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:11,960
OK.

50
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,540
So there's that middleware done.

51
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,460
And we also want to copy over the views and the handlers.

52
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's do the handlers first.

53
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,770
So I'll copy this whole thing and paste it here.

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,460
And my handlers are called, Where are they off, dash handlers?

55
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:40,870
OK, so we're going to copy from handlers and we want off dash handlers.

56
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,370
Don't go to text to handlers

57
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,660
of dash handlers.

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,260
Don't go.

59
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:00,460
OK, so there's our handlers now we want our views and we have views in the views folder and views in

60
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,480
the mailer folder.

61
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,980
So let's copy this and we'll do the ones in the mail folder first.

62
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:16,690
So we're copying from Mailer, which is what it's called in templates, and the file is called Password

63
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,180
Dash Reset HTML that tempo.

64
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,990
Two male and we're calling this file

65
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:49,210
password Dash Reset Dash HTML the template, now we'll copy this whole thing and do the plain text version

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,590
and scroll up a bit.

67
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,820
And this becomes plain and this becomes plain.

68
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:06,580
OK, so we have the male templates now we have to do the reset templates and the log in template in

69
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:13,570
the Views folder, so I'll copy this and paste it here and we're copying from views.

70
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,010
The IWC what do I have my views folder?

71
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,500
Did I remember to copy over the log in one?

72
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,280
No, I didn't.

73
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,820
So let's go back over here and go down to views.

74
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:35,100
We also want the login page, so we'll copy that over to up one level views.

75
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,230
So log in, goes to views there.

76
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,930
OK, so the first one we want is from views.

77
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,780
Log in, Georgette.

78
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,780
Two views.

79
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,690
Log in, D'Achat.

80
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,950
And I will copy this and paste it twice, once, twice.

81
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,870
And the second one is not called log in.

82
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:25,080
It's called for God jet, which becomes for God jet and reset dash password dot jet becomes reset dash

83
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,760
password dot.

84
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,720
All right.

85
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,080
So that should copy all of those files over.

86
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,970
Now there's one more thing we need to do.

87
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,580
Let's go back over to our other project and that is my app and look inside the data folder.

88
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,250
I believe we added a function.

89
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,930
Yes, we did to our check.

90
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:50,490
Remember, we added this function to the user's dgo data in the data file, so I copied that function.

91
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,880
Now I'm going to switch back here and open up user don't go, don't text and paste that right here,

92
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,490
there, and that should take care of all of the heavy lifting.

93
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,030
So let's try compiling our seal on.

94
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,910
Make sure everything compiles make build, underscore seal seelye.

95
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,240
And it did.

96
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,150
OK, so I'll leave it to you to test that, but that should work exactly as expected.

97
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,590
And of course, in order to test it, you have to go and delete the necessary tables from your database

98
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,670
and then delete all of the things that are copied over in the data directory, in the mail directory,

99
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:40,650
in the handlers directory, in the middleware directory and the views directory.

100
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,260
So once you delete all the files that are installed, when someone typed celebrities make off and you

101
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,450
remove the necessary migrations and the necessary tables in the database, you should be able to run

102
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,970
this and everything should work as expected.

103
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,440
Now, I'm not going to bother testing it in this lecture because we're moving on in the next section

104
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,530
to building a make new functionality into our celebrity voice command line application, and we'll test

105
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,520
it at that point.

106
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,850
And if we got something wrong, it's not going to be anything major.

107
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,620
So let's move on to the next section.
