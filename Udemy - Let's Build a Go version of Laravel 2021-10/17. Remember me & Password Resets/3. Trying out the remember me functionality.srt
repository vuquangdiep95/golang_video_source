1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,990
So let's try it, our check, remember functionality, and right now I'm in my app and I'm looking at

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,760
the roots go, and obviously one of the first things we have to do is to add the necessary middleware,

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,880
which is as simple as adult use.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,860
And I want a middleware Typekit check.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,280
Remember?

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,090
OK, so that adds the middleware to our roots.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,580
Now, if we go over to our dot on the file and we go to the session bit.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,830
You can see that I'm using a recession, and if you're not switchers to read, it's just that we're

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,670
doing the same thing.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,150
Now let's go back over to celebrities that project and see how long sessions are set to last.

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:50,770
So over here and celebrities, if we look at the part where we actually in it, things, so we have

12
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,800
our celebrities to go and we look at new.

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,070
So here's the new bit.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,020
Let's find the bit where we initialize our sessions.

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,290
So our session lifetime is set to see de-conflict cookie dot lifetime.

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,350
OK, so if we go back to our dot on file, it will look at our cookie lifetime that's set to one thousand

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,640
four hundred and forty minutes.

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,470
So change that to one.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,390
OK, so it'll be one minute.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:24,670
And now I'm going to open my terminal and make sure that my Docker images are running Docker compose

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,790
up dash.

22
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,450
And that should start Docker for me.

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,330
Now I'll run my application.

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,590
Make start.

25
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:45,880
OK.

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,780
So it's running.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,720
And let's go back to our Web browser and reload, this page localhost four thousand.

28
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,630
OK, so I am not logged in, which is good.

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,110
Now let's try logging in.

30
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,040
I'll log in as me out here dot com with the password password and I will check.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,950
Remember me and log in.

32
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:09,910
OK.

33
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,460
So I'm logged in now, I'm going to pause the video and I'll wait a little more than a minute and then

34
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,010
I'll refresh this page and I should still be logged in even though my sessions are set to one minute.

35
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,530
So I'll see you in 60 seconds or so.

36
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,070
So a little more than a minute has gone by.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,250
So my session should have timed out by now, and I'm going to reload this page and you can see I'm still

38
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,790
logged in.

39
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,960
So I remember me functionality seems to be working as it should.

40
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,860
So the next thing I'd like to do is to take care of this.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,490
Let's go log out here and click on forgot password.

42
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,950
Well, don't click on it because there's nothing behind it right now.

43
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,020
What I'd like to do next is to implement that functionality as well, and it's really simple, so we'll

44
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,910
get started on that in the next lecture.
