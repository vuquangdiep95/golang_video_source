1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,130
So this time around, we want to implement password resets.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,470
In other words, someone is trying to log into the system and they can't remember what password they

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:09,860
used.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,740
So they click on a little link labeled forgot password.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,330
Enter their email address.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,670
The system checks to make sure we have a user with that email address, and if we do, we generate a

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,910
secure email with a link in it and send it to the user.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,410
The user clicks on that link and enters a new password.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,860
Verifies the password.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,940
Click Save and their password has been changed and they can log in.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,820
So to get started, we're going to need a couple of views.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,830
And if you go to the course resources for this lecture, you'll see a zip file you can download called

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,050
Forgot Dash Views or something like that.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,440
Extract the contents and you'll find two files.

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,310
One is called forgot jet and one is called Reset Password.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:57,080
So extract these zip file and put those two jets jet files right in The View's folder in my app, and

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,800
let's have a look at them.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,570
So here we have one called forgot.

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,350
OK?

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,910
And forgot his very straightforward.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,740
He uses the base layout, we set a title.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,540
We have nothing in the CSE's block and in page content is a simple form and it has.

23
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,140
You'll notice here something called dot error and that doesn't exist yet in our template.

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,870
So we're going to have to add that in just a moment, and we will.

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,670
But this is a very simple form they put in their email address.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,360
They click, send password, reset email and we do something on the back.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,540
So that's the first one.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,490
And the second one is called Reset Password Dot Jet, and it's pretty much the same.

29
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,040
Only now they enter their password, they enter their new password and they click Reset password.

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,120
OK, so the first thing we're going to do is we'll create a handler that displays this page forgot dot.

31
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,070
Just before we can do that.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,350
Of course, we need to add that type error to our template data, and we don't do that in my app.

33
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,580
We do that over in this file.

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,230
Render Don't go in the celebrities project.

35
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,790
So bring that up.

36
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,650
And let's add a few fields to this.

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,720
We'll add some that we'll be using later on anyway.

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,620
So the first of all we want is called error, and it's just a string.

39
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,580
OK.

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,660
And we're also going to put in a flash, which is again going to be a string, and that'll be a message

41
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,860
that goes to the session.

42
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,710
Just briefly, it goes there for only the next request.

43
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,160
It's called a flash message, so we can do something with that in a bit.

44
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,180
OK, so let's save this, and then let's switch back to our other project.

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,680
And now that we have our views where they need to be, we obviously need to go to our handlers.

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,290
So let's go to art handlers.

47
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,080
Don't go inside the handlers folder in my app.

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,910
And let's just write a really simple handler that displays the forgot page.

49
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,140
So funk with receiver of pointer to handlers, and we'll call this one forgot.

50
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,370
That's simple enough.

51
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,400
It should be paid off response writer and as a pointer to issue tip request.

52
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,760
And all we're going to do here is just render a template.

53
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,130
So that's as simple as errors.

54
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,430
Assign the value of each dot render and we give it W and her the name of our template, which is forgot

55
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,580
because ours is called forgot dot jet and nothing for data.

56
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,900
And we check for an error if error is not equal to nil.

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,190
And I'll just write to the log file each Dot app.

58
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,720
The error log dot print line,

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,950
error rendering with the error, and then I'll call say, H Dot app.

60
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,990
Dot your status.

61
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,360
Air 500, that's a good one.

62
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,840
And what does that require Air 500 requires?

63
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,350
The W in the air.

64
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:52,790
That's it.

65
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,030
W R and that's it.

66
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,780
OK.

67
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,610
So now, if I go to my roots, Farro, which we have to have a route to as first of all, let's find

68
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,680
out what link we have on the in page.

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,430
When someone clicks on forgot password, they are going here slash user slash forgot password.

70
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,660
OK, so I've got the link.

71
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,580
Now let's open our routes file.

72
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,950
And I'll put it right here with the rest of the user roots, so I can just type aid on, get and give

73
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:32,950
it the route I want, so I'll paste that root in there and it goes to aid our handlers but forgot handlers

74
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,250
there.

75
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,140
So now I should be able to start my application.

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,100
Let's start.

77
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,070
OK, so let's go back to.

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,480
Web browser, and I'll click on, log in the user and make sure this page renders the way that it should.

79
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,860
Alex Cook.

80
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,740
OK, so you have to enter an email address and off you go.

81
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,390
Now that was the easy part.

82
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,990
Obviously, we need to do a bit more work once someone actually puts in an email address and clicks,

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,410
send password, reset email and we'll get started on that in the next lecture.
