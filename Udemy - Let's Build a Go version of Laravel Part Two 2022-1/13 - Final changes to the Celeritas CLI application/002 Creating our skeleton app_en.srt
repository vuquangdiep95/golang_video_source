1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:07,360
So the next step is to make some changes to our my app and make sure that's the skeleton app that's

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,310
committed to a git repository that our installer will use our command line application uses.

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,790
The very first thing you should do is make a backup of your entire my app folder and put it somewhere

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,750
where you're not going to lose it.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,610
So make sure you do that because we're going to be deleting a fair bit of the things that we worked

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:30,340
on in the course so far because none of them are necessary for an empty celebrity's application.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,619
So I've already backed mine up, so we'll get started.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,830
So the first thing I'll do is look at my roots file, which is, of course, right here.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:46,240
Roots don't go in my app and I'm going to delete everything except for the home root and the static

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,990
roots, of course.

11
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,340
OK, so I'll delete these.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,340
And they're gone.

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,480
And this is basically all that I want to have in the default application, so I'll mount the routes

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,220
that are directly from celebrities.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,210
I'll leave that and amount the API routes, which I have to open now and make sure that this is empty

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,490
because you don't need that at all.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,130
So there's my first two changes now that I've deleted all of those routes.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,610
I don't need the handlers that are associated with them either.

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,650
So let's find handlers and let's open up handlers don't go and see if there's anything there we want

20
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,190
to leave in.

21
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,830
Well, I want to leave in the home route.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,590
No question.

23
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:25,950
It's all.

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,560
Delete this, everything after that.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,770
All the way down to here.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,530
And now we just have the home rule, so that's good.

27
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,270
Any imports break?

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,170
No, that's good.

29
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,060
So far, so good.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,400
Now, handlers test, I've left one in there, the test for the home route.

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,450
Let's have a look at set up test to make sure there's nothing in there that needs to change.

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,050
There is, of course, we don't have this route anymore, so that's gone.

33
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,410
Perfect.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,449
Mail didn't change middleware, do I want to delete anything out of here?

35
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,470
Yes, I do.

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,880
As a matter of fact, I also want to delete off handlers don't know anything that was installed when

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,540
you type the command from our Seelye that implements authentication.

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,870
Those need to be deleted.

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,160
So that includes in the data folder.

40
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,110
Remember, token token and user, those can get deleted.

41
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:35,270
And that means in models, we'll have to delete these three entries here where we return models in the

42
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:41,270
new command and we'll have to delete these entries up here in the type of models.

43
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,560
OK, so that's fine.

44
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,140
Those are gone.

45
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,660
Then we delete off handlers.

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:59,380
That can go when we go down a little bit further here to auth token and remember and ask, don't go

47
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,180
in middleware, those go.

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,030
We look at our mega migrations folder and simply make sure that's entirely empty.

49
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,100
That's gone.

50
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,440
In public, that's fine, those can stay.

51
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,090
Camps should be empty, and it's ignored by get anyway views.

52
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:32,070
We're going to get rid of celebrities, upload forgot, list us Logan, reset password protester and

53
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,070
upload those all go away.

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,550
We just leave the home jet and the associated base layout.

55
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,080
Dawn was not committed to get so it doesn't matter the celebrity binaries, not committed to get, so

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,950
it doesn't matter.

57
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,180
Dr. Campos.

58
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,900
Now, I don't see any changes that I really need to make in there, and that should be fine.

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,880
OK, go modest is fine.

60
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,430
And as far as I can see, that's all we need to worry about for this.

61
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,730
So my next step and I'm not going to bother making you watch me do this is just to commit this to a

62
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,560
git repository and tag it.

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,230
I'm going to tag mine version two because I'll be pushing it to the repository that I used in the first

64
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,310
half of this course.

65
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:26,420
So do that, and we can move on to the next step, which is updating which skeleton application we pulled

66
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,440
down from.

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,040
Get in our Seelye and we'll get started on that in the next lecture.
