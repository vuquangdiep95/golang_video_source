1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,850
So I've pushed all of the changes to my skeleton app and to this celebrity application, both up to

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,940
the git repositories on GitHub, so make sure you do that.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,320
And now I want to test things out.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,100
So in the celebrities project, I'll open a terminal window and I'll build the new executable, and

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,080
all I have to do is type, make, build.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,770
And that should build the executable into the folder named Dist.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,650
So if I do with lastest, there it is.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,330
What I do now is I'll copy that executable to my desktop and you can copy it wherever you want.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,020
But I need to copy the actual file dist celebrities and of course, in windows that celebrities don't

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,560
see or something like that.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,360
And I'll copy it to the desktop.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,530
You can copy to whatever folder you want, but I know there's nothing up there on my desktop, so I

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,070
can do that.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:56,640
Now I'll move to my desktop CD desktop and I'll create a new application, a new celerity application

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,480
by typing dot slash celebrities like that.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,470
And of course, in windows, you just type to start.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,340
And I'll say new, and I'll call this Test app, and that should create a new folder named Test app.

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,000
And it did.

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,190
OK, so now let's open that up.

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,640
So I'll go to the file menu and open up.

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,830
From my desktop, I want test up, so I open that folder and open it.

22
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,020
And I open it in a new window, and there it is.

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,480
Now let's open a terminal window and see if it works.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,380
Oh, I should have to do at this point is say, make start.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,770
So it's running, that's a good sign.

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,380
Let's go over to our Web browser and see if it works.

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,710
I'll open a new tab and go to local host 4000.

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,400
And it seems to work exactly as it should.

29
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,840
Now we haven't tried any of this new functionality, and we'll do that in the next few lectures.

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,340
But so far it seems like my celebrities command on application is doing exactly what it should.

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,260
All right, let's take a little bit of time and just test out some of the functionality and make sure

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,210
that everything works the way that it should.
