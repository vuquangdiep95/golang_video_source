1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,600
So I've pushed all the changes for my celebrity, I say application, the skeleton application up to

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,140
a repository named GitHub dot com slash t solar slash celebrity house Dash app and of course, your

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,790
repository name might be different.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,840
And I have also pushed all of the changes for my celebrity project to its own repository, which is

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,080
GitHub dot com slash t solar slash Solaris house.

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:31,610
Now let's try things out, and not everything is going to work back in my I.D., I have opened up the

7
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,760
celebrity app in its own project window, as you can see here, and I've also, as you can see here,

8
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,060
opened up celebrities in its own project.

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:46,190
And there's a few changes I need to make to start with back in this one Celebrity House Dash app.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,260
And that's the skeleton application.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,270
There were a few things I didn't actually do in the last lecture, and none of them are terribly difficult

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,830
to fix, but we need to fix them.

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:02,690
So to start with, I emptied out the mail folder because there were two mail templates left over from

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,230
when I was testing things, and they don't need to be there in the skeleton application.

15
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,330
So I deleted those.

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,960
So the mail folder is empty.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,620
I also, if you open up the database, don't worry, email file in the config folder.

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,810
I just removed all of the values next to these keys because not everyone's going to use the database

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,060
and we shouldn't be repopulating that with anything.

20
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:31,240
The third thing I did, and this was an oversight on my part is in the views folder in layouts based

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,960
on jet.

22
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:38,770
I remove that nav tag, the dropdown menu, the menu bar at the top of the screen because those links

23
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,840
all pointed to things that don't exist anymore.

24
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,650
So that's gone.

25
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,360
Now, the next one was over in the celebrities project.

26
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:56,120
Inside the CMG folder, inside the Templates folder, the dot on file.

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,280
Here, if you scroll down to the part, it's line sixty four in my my code, the encryption key.

28
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,840
Remember when I deleted that?

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,120
Well, we actually need to put this in here.

30
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,080
Dollar sign.

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,400
Brace bracket.

32
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,570
KFYI.

33
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,620
Brace bracket.

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,150
And the reason ends when I run the new command, which you find in New Dongo, I actually use that somewhere

35
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,600
in here.

36
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,110
There it is.

37
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:27,970
Line fifty seven actually generate a random 32 character string and replace that value right here with

38
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,110
that random character.

39
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,090
So that needs to be there.

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,510
Just an oversight on my part.

41
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,780
And the last thing to worry about is actually in the go dot mod text file.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,030
When I did my copy and replace, I actually left this lying down here replacing GitHub dot com slash

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,190
whatever the path to your Solaris house folder is.

44
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,280
We don't want to replace that anymore in production.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,500
And in fact, I'm actually also going to just to make things easier.

46
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,910
Delete this line up here where I require the Celerity Project version zero zero zero because that doesn't

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,480
exist.

48
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,250
So to make things work a little bit better, what I'll do is delete that line entirely.

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,980
Then I'll go back to the new Dot Go file and we close this new dot go.

50
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,800
And if we go down near the bottom here.

51
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:29,350
Where I do go on tidy right here, what I'm going to do is before I run, go on tidy, I'll actually

52
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:38,380
just copy all of this right here and paste it after that little message that I'm running, go Monty.

53
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:46,720
And instead, I will say, Go get it and I'll put in the past name to my celebrity house repository,

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,190
which in my case is GitHub dot com slash t solar slash celebrities.

55
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,510
And the reason I'm doing that is that this way I don't have to worry about what version is tagged up

56
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:58,820
there.

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,270
And of course, if you want to tag it and get a specific version, you can do that.

58
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,600
But this way, I'll always get the latest version of what's in the main branch of my repository, and

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,990
I'll never put anything in the main branch that hasn't been thoroughly tested, so this should solve

60
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,500
the problem.

61
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,490
And of course, that means I need to come down here and make this an equals operator instead of an assignment

62
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,060
operator.

63
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,860
And that should take care of it.

64
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,900
So in the next lecture, we'll actually try things out and generate a new application and see if things

65
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,230
work.
