1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,820
So now that we have most of the code changes done, insularity us and my app, it's time to update a

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,590
couple of things.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,540
And the two things we need to update our first of all, these skeleton git repository when we create

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,530
a new application using celebrities new whatever your project name is.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,010
It goes and grabs a gift repository, clones it and then makes changes to it using the Seelye automatically.

6
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,860
So we'll have to make changes to the skeleton get repository, which in my case just means updating

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,100
my app and pushing a version of that to my get repository.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,110
The second thing we need to do is to make some minor changes to the command line application itself.

9
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,270
So we'll get started with that right now.

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,020
So first thing I want to do is look at my app.

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,390
Now there are some things that are not on the get repository that will be there automatically as soon

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,360
as I commit and push them.

13
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,350
For example, we have this config folder that has database dot.

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:54,610
Why?

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,380
And of course, that's used by our version of soda that we've encoded right into our project.

16
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,920
So we'll want to put an empty version of that up, and that's easy enough in the same way.

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,440
If we look in the handlers folder, we have this handlers underscore test go.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,210
And I don't want to put all of these tests here because that was just for our purposes as we were making

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,340
sure that things work the way that they're supposed to.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,950
Now you could, of course, just comment about certain tests and leave them as examples, and that would

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,160
be extremely helpful.

22
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,350
But typically, if you're going to write something like this for other people to use, you would actually

23
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,000
write some real documentation.

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,060
And I'm not going to do that, or at least I'm not going to do that while you watch me.

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm not going to record a lecture with me writing documentation, but it's something you may wish to

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,040
do.

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,940
So what I'll do for our purposes is just leave the one test that I know will always be there, and that's

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,610
the home page test, and I'll just get rid of the rest of them.

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,060
So I'll select these and delete those.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,840
OK?

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,770
And if there's anything else here that needs to be pushed to the git repository, it'll just happen.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,310
OK.

33
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,720
So if we go back to our celebrities project now and we look in the CMT folder and then see a lie and

34
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:14,290
then the Templates folder, these are the files that are used when we automatically execute some command

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,210
that the end user enters.

36
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,820
We use these as files that we copy.

37
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,150
So the first one, of course, is inside these templates folder.

38
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,860
We have the data folder.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,520
We didn't change anything with that, so that should be fun.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,210
OK?

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,150
The handler's folder of handlers go that might have changed.

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,590
I'm not sure, and I'm not an optimist, and it's easy enough to come down here to handlers in the my

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:38,890
app.

44
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:47,650
Open up handlers don't go select all copy closes and then open up the template off handlers go down.

45
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,490
Delete what's in there and paste in the new version.

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,910
I know that's going to work now.

47
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,060
And yes, we did have some changes, so that's good.

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,600
That's good.

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,110
Handlers don't go.

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,400
Let's see what's in there, so we just have this right now that shouldn't change at all.

51
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,490
That's when you create a new stub handler.

52
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,240
So that's fine.

53
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,170
We didn't make any changes to males, so that should be fine.

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,190
What about middleware?

55
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,040
Well, again, there's three files here off.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,480
Don't go off token.

57
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,310
Don't go and remember ICO.

58
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:27,270
I'm not an optimist, so I'll open up middleware in my app, open ASCO, select all copy and then open

59
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,660
off and go here the text file paste in the new version, just to be sure.

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,350
Next is a token.

61
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,650
Select All copy and open up of Dash token.

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,760
Go select all paste.

63
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,430
And finally, remember.

64
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,230
So let's remember.

65
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,100
Don't go right here.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,050
Select All Copy.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:05,080
And remember that no select paste and I should do it for those ones migrations.

68
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,720
Anything change in there?

69
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,880
I don't think so.

70
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,750
We'll find out if I've missed something when we actually try this views.

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,529
So we have log in the jet that might have changed as it did.

72
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,279
I believe let's go down to our views in my app.

73
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,930
Right here and open up, log in.

74
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,870
So that includes the logging with GitHub, logging with Google Play Music with those in there.

75
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,820
So I copy that.

76
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,140
Close all of those and open up.

77
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:37,980
Log in.

78
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,620
Select All Paste.

79
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,820
OK.

80
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,200
That should take care of that.

81
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,350
Next is the dot on the file, and that's definitely changed, so I'll open up the dot on file here in

82
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,010
my app.

83
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,860
Select Go and Copy.

84
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:02,420
And if I look at the template on which is called on site, it actually uses dollar sign and then in

85
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:12,470
curly braces and underscore name and is here on line two here for the red as prefix on line 29 and down

86
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,730
here in line thirty five.

87
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,820
Those three places, so I'll select all and paste.

88
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,880
Now I'll get rid of the things that don't belong in there so I can leave at the very bottom with these

89
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,120
three.

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,310
For Google, I get rid of this secret.

91
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,660
You don't want to put that in there by default, and I'll get rid of the key.

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,450
And I'll get rid of the secret for GitHub.

93
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,590
And get rid of the key.

94
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,320
That's fine.

95
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,360
And I should probably leave these empty as well, because some people may not use WebDAV.

96
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,510
Or SFP

97
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,500
or Mineo?

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,020
And the same thing for three.

99
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,630
You don't want to be putting this kind of information in a public repository at all, ever.

100
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,360
So those are gone.

101
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,410
The encryption key leave that empty.

102
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,140
You better spell settings, right, since I'm here anyway, but.

103
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,820
And, of course, this stuff I can leave empty as well, because not everyone will be using the database

104
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,120
at all.

105
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,900
Now, let's fix my app.

106
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,040
That should be Dollar Sun app.

107
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:05,670
Underscore name and close that and copy this, and we want it for us, prefix.

108
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,340
And we want it for cookie name.

109
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,180
OK, now let's say it's something that should be it for that one.

110
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,200
So the next one is go on, go on.

111
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,800
And of course, that has app name up here as well.

112
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,290
So let's open the other one, because that's definitely changed.

113
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:32,390
We'll find God in my app and I'll select everything from go one point one seven all the way down to

114
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,050
the bottom here.

115
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,560
Like that, you know, replace this from here.

116
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,240
All the way down to here.

117
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,470
So hopefully that will be correct.

118
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,820
We'll find out when we try it.

119
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,160
Now, I don't immediately see anything else that has to change here in the Templates folder.

120
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:02,540
So the next step is to go make whatever changes are required in our command line application and to

121
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:09,260
push our skeleton app up to our repository, which means deleting some things before we do that.

122
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,700
And let me try this out.

123
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,040
So we'll get started on that in the next election.
