1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,880
So in this section of the course, what I want to do is take all the work we put into the last section

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,920
and add some functionality to the core celebrity's code that makes uploading a file to any file system,

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,430
including the local system on a server absolutely trivial to make it a one line command with an error

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,150
check, of course.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,550
So something like this, and I'm just sticking this into a random handler just so you can see what the

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,720
code might look like.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,430
Perhaps something like this error is a sign of the value of.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,790
And this is going to show errors in my I.D. and just ignore that.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,770
Here's the sort of thing I want something like a dart app.

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,160
Dart upload file.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,970
So right from the celebrity's application, a command named upload file.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,980
And that would take something like the request, the name of the field that we're uploading, say,

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,940
uploaded file and then what file system do you want it to go to?

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,690
So something like and we could get it out of the map and maybe even make it easier something like H

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,180
Dart app Dart.

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,770
You know you.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,330
Like that leads to an air check.

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,490
So basically one line of code.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,390
And of course, we're getting all of these errors because I'm referring to things that don't exist right

20
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,890
now, but hopefully you get the idea.

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,420
One line of code that allows me to pass just basically at the request, the name of the field in the

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,390
request that we're passing it, that has the file attached.

23
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,180
And then we have a file system you want it to go to.

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,910
And that's what I want to work on in this section.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,740
So let's get started in the next election.
