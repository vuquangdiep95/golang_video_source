1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,160
So let's give things a try.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,520
I'll open my terminal.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,300
I'll make sure I'm inside my my app directory.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,220
I am, and I'll type make start.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000
So everything starts up, and let's go to our web browser and over here.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,820
Remember, we're going to be uploading to my Amazon s three system, which is actually on A. In my case,

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,220
and I'm looking at my object storage and celebrities the name of the bucket that I have connected to

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,500
my app and there's nothing in there right now, which is perfect.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:37,270
So if I go to the homepage of my site and go to filesystems list files and choose S3 bucket, I should

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,630
get nothing.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,770
Perfect.

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,460
Now the moment of truth, let's go to local host.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,180
4000 slash upload.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,490
OK, so far so good.

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,610
Let's try uploading a picture.

16
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,780
So I'll choose this one called lorem dash blue dot pink, and I'll try uploading it.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,090
And it says it uploaded.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,260
So let's go back to our tab here for listing the file systems listed.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,190
And there it is.

20
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,000
Perfect.

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,530
Now let's go back here.

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:15,460
And this time, I'll close this little message and I'll browse, and I'll try to upload a Microsoft

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,260
Word document, and I have one stuck right here.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,720
We're Dot Dot X.

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,830
And that's not in my allowed mime types.

26
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,830
Let's try uploading that.

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,140
And it says invalid file type upload.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,000
Now I have that is the wrong color, which is my own fault, and that's easy enough to fix it.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,560
I'll leave that as an exercise for you.

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,280
But this is not a production web page.

31
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,590
This is just to try things out, and I'm pretty happy because it's now limiting the upload by my type.

32
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,170
Now I don't happen to have a file more than 10 megs and I to try to upload, but I know that's going

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,600
to work and I'll leave that as an exercise for you.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,740
So the last thing I want to take care of and this is just a bit of housekeeping.

35
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:04,850
Back to our I.T. and hide this and look inside the My App folder inside of the temp directory.

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,449
Every time I upload something, the temporary file stays there, and that's a bit of a pain.

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,840
So let's try this instead.

38
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:21,140
Let's open up the Upload File Upload doc, go from celebrities and right here upload file.

39
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,950
After my statement and before my return, I'm going to put it differ in there, so I'll defer a function

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,420
that returns nothing.

41
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,180
But it does require the parentheses at the end here.

42
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,860
I'm going to defer a simple call with an explicit ignore of the error code.

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,720
So if there's an error, I don't care about it and I'm going to call off start remove.

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,580
Now, what I want to remove is really just the name.

45
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,240
I got back from that call to see Dot get file to upload.

46
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,890
So filing that should be the full path to the file that I want to delete.

47
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,650
And because I'm deferring it down here explicitly, I know this is not going to run until everything

48
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,140
up here is done, and I think that is a little bit cleaner and safer.

49
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,740
So this will empty out our temp directory.

50
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,880
There'll be nothing in there when everything works on delete those.

51
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,640
So the next time I run this, after I upload a file and get a success message, that temp directory

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,050
should still be empty.

53
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,210
OK, that is enough for this time around.

54
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,730
Let's move on to the next section.
