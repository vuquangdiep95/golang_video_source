1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:08,580
So let's make configuring which mime types are allowed for file uploads a lot easier for end users,

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,810
because right now, if we deploy our application the way that it is, no one will be able to upload

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,080
anything except for images and PDFs, and that's no good.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,800
So we'll start by opening the door on file in my app and I'll go near the bottom of this file and I'll

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,550
put it in here.

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,150
Permitted upload types.

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,870
Just a comment.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:36,030
So the key will be called allowed file types and they'll be equal to a string.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,810
And I do have to put this in quotation marks, so this probably won't work.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,160
And I'll just put image, gif and then a car with no spaces.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:54,910
Image slash JPEG and then another comma image slash PNG and then another comma and then application

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,790
slash PDF.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:58,720
OK.

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,530
And what we'll do is read that and put it into a slice and add it to our configuration at system startup

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:05,830
time.

16
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:17,890
And we may, as will also put in the max upload size and just make that equal to one two four eight

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,790
five seven.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,630
Six zero zero zero.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,230
10 mins.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,760
OK, so this is in bytes.

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,060
So now those are in the own file and of course, we have to do something with them.

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,860
So let's go back to the file.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,360
Celebrities don't go.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,550
Now, what I want to add is something to this type config.

25
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,940
So what I want to put in here is maybe something that's called upload config, so will define another

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,270
type.

27
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,900
I can put that in the file type Stargirl, but I'll put it here just for simplicity.

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,110
I'll call this upload config and will be a struct

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:06,660
with just a couple of members say aloud mime types, and that will be a slice of strings and Mac's upload

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,350
size.

31
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,740
They'll just make that an N64.

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:12,780
OK.

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:24,270
And now I'll add that to the field, which I call uploads of type upload config.

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,270
OK, now let's scroll down to where we populate this config type.

35
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:40,330
Right here, let's just add a comment in here that says file uploads, so I'll just declare a variable

36
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,160
called exploded, which I better spell, right, because I'm going to split a string, I'm going to

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,180
explode a string, and I'll do that by calling from the strings package.

38
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,060
Dot split right from the standard library.

39
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,480
And I want to split OS God, get on and I'm looking for a loud file types.

40
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,220
And I want to split that on a comma, OK, and then I'll create a variable mime types.

41
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:21,150
My which will be a slice of strings and I'll just range through exploded for underscore m for mime type.

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,020
They're populated by calling range exploding.

43
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,220
And would you say mine types is equal to append mine types?

44
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,580
OK, so that gives me the mime types that I'm going to be using momentarily.

45
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,670
Now let's declare another variable.

46
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,370
Max upload size of type in 64.

47
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:59,840
And we'll try this, we'll see if this in the next line, if Max and potentially an error come from

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,130
stricken 8y.

49
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,210
We're going to convert a string to an integer.

50
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:12,080
And we want to look at polls, don't get on max upload sites right there.

51
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:22,190
And if the error is not equal to nil, then we'll say max upload size is equal to and she's always before

52
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,050
10 megs else.

53
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,940
Max upload size is equal to what cast it to an int.

54
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,750
Sixty four.

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,160
Thanks.

56
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:46,680
Then down here, where we populate the config, we'll just add the field uploads and that will be equal

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,820
to an upload config.

58
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:56,670
That's the type we'll populate its two fields max upload size is max upload size and allowed mine types

59
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,770
is mine types.

60
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,970
And that should take care of all of the errors, so let's format this.

61
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:14,130
The last change is to go back to upload, go and find that variable valid mine types and get rid of

62
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,280
it not using anymore and instead read this from the config.

63
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:27,420
So it becomes See Got review, which is our receiver dot config uploads allowed nine times and then

64
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,380
down here.

65
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,120
Or up here.

66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,840
This gets changed to see ducks and fig uploads dot.

67
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,390
Max upload size there.

68
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,890
Now we allow the users to specify how big the uploads can be and what mime types they want to accept.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,880
So the next step is to create a handler and a page in my app and try this out and see what we got wrong

70
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,340
and we'll get started on that in the next election.
