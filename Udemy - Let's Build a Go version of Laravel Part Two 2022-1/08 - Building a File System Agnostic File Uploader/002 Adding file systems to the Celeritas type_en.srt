1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,140
So in order to make things simpler, before we start writing the actual generic uploading code.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,380
Let's go to the file celebrities don't go and just simplify the tape a little bit, so the file celebrities

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,500
don't go in the celebrities project.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,440
And right here at the top of the file, we have this type of celebrities.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,290
And right now, all of her file systems are stored in a map with an index of string and the contents

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,620
of interface, which could probably be file systems dot EFS.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,000
But that's fine for now.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,770
So let's instead add three or four new types, or 14 fields.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:43,070
That's three, which will be a type as three file system Dot S3, and we'll add SFP of type SFTP file

10
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,670
system setup and obviously WebDAV

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,460
of Typekit WebDAV file system WebDAV.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,140
And finally, meanwhile, I've type, you know, file systems document.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,069
I o OK, so that way we won't have to pull our value out of the map and cast it to the correct type,

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,239
which doesn't bother me.

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,810
I don't mind doing that at all, but lots of people want to keep things as simple as possible.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,960
Now we'll be down to the Create File Systems function, which I believe is near the bottom of the file

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:15,890
right here.

18
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:26,810
And in addition to populating the map file systems with S3, now we can say C Dot S3 is equal to a three.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,430
And again, that's three that's better.

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,670
And down here, see, meanwhile, IO is equal to the Nile.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,660
And here she is.

22
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,730
SFTP is equal to SFTP.

23
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,410
And finally, see that WebDAV is equal to WebDAV.

24
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,840
OK, that'll just make it easier for us to access the correct file system when we call our uploader.

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,720
OK, let's move on in the next lecture.
