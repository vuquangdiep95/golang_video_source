00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,170
So in order to test out our Amazon S3 bucket compatible file system, I need to create something now

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,090
I could use minimal because it is by default, an Amazon S3 compatible server.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,620
But honestly, I've never had much luck trying to use straight Amazon code with Mineo, and that's largely

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,120
because I didn't put much effort into it.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,020
I like to use the correct driver for the correct file system.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,980
So what I'll do is create a bucket online note.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,840
Now you can do it on digital oceans.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,230
You can do it on Amazon if you want to, or any provider that gives a compatible S3 bucket compatible

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:37,890
file system.

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,140
So online mode, it's pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,550
I've logged in and this is what I see when I log in and it's just that lynda.com line ODI dot com and

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,380
you can create an account there if you want to.

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,530
But you might have to spend real money, typically very often at least know offers a $100 credit for

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,390
new sign ups.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,140
So you can use that and then just cancel your account after the fact if you want to, or you can just

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,129
follow along and try this when you actually need to connect to a remote filesystem.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,990
But in any case, Lenard calls their S3 buckets object storage.

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,120
Digital ocean calls them spaces.

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,660
Amazon calls them S3 buckets, but other object storage.

20
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,130
And as you can see, I have quite a few buckets already, but I'll create a new bucket.

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,470
OK, which I will call over here, celebrities and I'm going to select my region.

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,590
And what I'm going to choose is Newark, New Jersey, which is relatively close to where I am physically

23
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,040
located.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,770
OK.

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,080
And I'll create the bucket.

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,810
So that creates a new bucket called celebrities, which I'll see somewhere along here.

27
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:46,600
Right there.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,830
OK, so it's created now I'll click on celebrities just to see what we have.

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,860
And you can see that there are no files here right now.

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,360
And I can look at access.

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,950
And I'm going to leave this private or I can leave it authenticated, read public, read public read,

32
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,220
right?

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,410
I'll make my public read OK.

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,169
And I'll also leave cause enabled to turn on and share for sale.

35
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,690
Tell us, let's see what this is.

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,680
I could put my own certificate in there, but I'll use the default TLS certificate, which is fine.

37
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,180
OK, so there we are for that.

38
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,100
Now, if I go back to object storage.

39
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:32,530
I need to create access to it, so I'll click on Access Keys up here and I'll generate an access key

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,060
and I will call this one celebrities.

41
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,940
OK, and I'll just leave everything turned on.

42
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,080
I'm not going to give it limited access at all.

43
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,150
So I'll create the access key.

44
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,750
Now, at this point, don't close this window until you copy this information, so I'm going to copy

45
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:59,410
this first one called Access Key, and I will switch over to my I.D. and I'm going to open the door

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,180
on the file in my app.

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,740
And here we have a key for streets or paste that in there, and I'm going to revoke this after I finish

48
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,700
recording the course.

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,330
So don't bother trying to use mine and I'll copy the secret key and I'll go back to my I.D. and I'll

50
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,490
paste the secret in there now because I chose New Jersey.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,190
I'm going to put U.S. Dash East Dash one in there as my region.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,850
And if you create yours in a different region, of course, you'll have to put a different region in

53
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,020
there.

54
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,520
And if you get the region wrong, you won't be able to connect at all.

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,610
And my end point for this, it's pretty easy for a with us Dash East Dash one, whatever your region

56
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,830
is, dot lynn odd objects dot com.

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,260
And my bucket name, I call celebrities.

58
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,360
I make sure you get all of this right.

59
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,910
Because one of the most frustrating things is doing something like reversing this secret in the key

60
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,070
or misspelling the endpoint or leaving an extra character in or out of the bucket name.

61
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,790
So make sure you get all of that right.

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,240
OK.

63
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,440
And I can go back here now to my web browser and closes and I'm all set.

64
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,160
OK.

65
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,760
So there's my celebrity key, and I'm all set.

66
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,060
And if I ever want to revoke that key, I just revoke it right here.

67
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,340
OK, so now that we have celebrities hooked up to our file system and we've created a bucket we can

68
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,450
access, it's time to go, update our handlers and then finally try things out.

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,030
So we'll get started on that in the next lecture.
