1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,390
So the last function we have to implement for our SRT file system before we connected to celebrities

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,540
is, of course, the get function little used but nice to have when you need it.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,730
And of course, the first thing I'm going to have to do is get some credentials and create a session.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,860
So I'll copy that from the other function, delete and just paste it down here before the return statement

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,270
in the get function.

6
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,010
OK.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,610
So I have my credentials, I have my session and now all I'm going to do is loop through my very attic

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,950
parameter items and process the get function for each entry I find there.

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,300
So four.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,470
Ignore the index.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,480
Pay attention to each individual item comes from ranging through items.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:56,500
And now I'm going to check for an error when I and this is an inline function which returns an error.

13
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:02,320
And I'm doing this because of course, I'm going to be deferring file clothes periodically.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,360
And this is exactly what we did before.

15
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:13,210
So I'll get a file and check for an error when I call OAC stock create and I'm going to create and this

16
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:21,610
will be a format string so formatted as print f, my string will be percent as slash percent s and the

17
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:28,270
substitutions will be destination, which I received as a parameter to this function and the current

18
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,570
item.

19
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,130
OK.

20
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,810
And I'll check for an error.

21
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,110
If error is not equal to nil, then return the error.

22
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,330
And down here I have to add my closing double parentheses, of course.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,890
So once I have the file, I'll defer closing it, which is why this is all wrapped in that anonymous

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,590
function, and I'll create a variable called downloader, which is assigned the value of.

25
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,930
And they should have filed in front of the clothes.

26
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,990
That was sloppy and there should be a capital C..

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,790
Apparently, I can't type today.

28
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,730
My downloader is an S3 manager, dot new downloader.

29
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,500
And it requires my session, and now I'll ignore the first return parameter, but check for an error

30
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:25,100
when I use Downloader to download the file, and that requires the file and the second parameter, and

31
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,990
I'll put this on another line, so it's easier to read is a reference to S3.

32
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:29,990
Three.

33
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,490
Get object input.

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:42,040
And that takes two fields the bucket, which, of course, is an AWOL string from my receiver escort

35
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,490
bucket.

36
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,730
And the second thing is the key.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,770
And then, of course, that's just A.W. Asked String the current item

38
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,050
and looks like I already have an error variable.

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,890
So this should not be an assignment operator and I'll format this.

40
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,490
So there's my downloader.

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,760
We check for an error.

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,330
If error is not equal to nil, then we'll just return the error.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,980
Otherwise we'll return nil.

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:26,680
OK, and then outside of this inline function, we do our last error check if error is not equal to

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
nil, then return the error.

46
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,420
And I think unless I have a typo somewhere, that should actually do it.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,900
So now we have all of our necessary functions implemented to satisfy the file system FC interface.

48
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,700
So the next step is to connect celebrities to our new S3 file system, and we'll get started on that

49
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,630
in the next lecture.
