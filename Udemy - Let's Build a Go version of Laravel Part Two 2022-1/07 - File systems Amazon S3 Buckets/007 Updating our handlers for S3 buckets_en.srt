00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,570
So before we can try things out, we obviously have to update our handlers for S3, so I'm in the file

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,840
handlers thought go in my app and I'm going to scroll down till I find list f's right here.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,260
So obviously here I need to copy one of these.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,480
I don't have to copy and it's just simpler and paste it here and change this to S3.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:30,300
And our file systems will be at the key S3 from H Dot APT file systems that map and we don't want to

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,630
cast it to a WebDAV.

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,100
We want to cast it to end as three file systems.

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,620
Three Enter a first type is a street, so that was easy enough.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,850
So let's keep going.

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,760
That was for listing a file system.

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,410
Now, upload to a file system that displays the page, this is the handler we want right here.

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:01:01,100
So again, we'll come down here and copy WebDAV and paste it here and change that to S3 and change this

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,519
to S3 and cast it to.

14
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,940
That's three file systems Dog S3.

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,460
Are there any more?

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,650
There should be get files.

17
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,760
Upload is fun delete from file system.

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,540
That's the last one, I believe, so we'll copy WebDAV.

19
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,870
Paste it here.

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,610
Change that to S3.

21
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,200
Change this to S3 and cast it to the correct type.

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,820
S3 File Systems S3 and I believe that's it.

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,540
Perfect.

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:38,270
OK, so now we're ready to try things out, and we'll do that in the next lecture.
