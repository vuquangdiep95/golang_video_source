1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,860
So we seem to have everything hooked up correctly, and it's time to give things a try.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,030
So I'll open up my terminal and I'll type make start, and when I hit return, it's going to start up,

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,600
but you'll get a warning saying you need to import the appropriate S3 file system from your celebrity's

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,080
project.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,670
Just copy and paste the go get command and then you should be able to start it up.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,750
So it's running out and I'll switch over to my browser and we'll give it a try.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,020
So I'll go to local host 4000 and I'll go to file systems and list files.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,560
And first of all, let's make sure the other ones work.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,240
So there's Mineo that still works.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,710
Let's try SFTP.

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,090
That works.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,510
And finally, WebDAV and that should work as well.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,750
And if I go to S3 Bucket, which is our topic of the moment and hit list, there should be nothing up

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,070
there and there's not.

15
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:51,880
That's good.

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:58,930
OK, so let's go over to our file systems and upload something to our S3 bucket, so I'll browse.

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,060
And I'll choose this ping.

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,830
This little image and upload it.

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,170
And it says it's uploaded great.

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,710
Now let's go back to our systems list files.

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,760
Choose SFTP now S3 bucket and list.

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,080
And there's still nothing there, which seems kind of weird.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,480
So I introduced a little bit of a problem, and I confess that I did so deliberately, but if I could

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,340
to my Lynnwood account.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,060
And go to object storage.

26
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,850
And look at celebrities, you'll see that files actually there, so it uploaded it properly, but it's

27
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,070
not listing it properly.

28
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,910
And fortunately, it's a really easy fix.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:48,130
So let's go back to our idea and I'll just hide my terminal and find the list command in S3 right here.

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:56,200
And the problem is this value that's being passed prefix when we pass a slash, which is the default

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,770
parameter.

32
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:02,770
If you haven't clicked to a lower level folder, when we we submit that form, it actually passes a

33
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,350
slash and Amazon doesn't like that slash.

34
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,630
So what we have to do here is just add a little check.

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,370
If prefix is equal to slash, then prefix is equal to an empty string.

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,720
And that's one of the differences between Mineo, which takes care of the slash automatically and Amazon's

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,120
code or or library, which does not.

38
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,250
So now if I go make a restart or mix it up and make start.

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,290
And go back to my Web browser and get to the correct the page list files.

40
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,950
Now, when I choose S3 Bucket, it should show me that file.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,580
And it does.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,650
And let's try deleting it.

43
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,700
Yes.

44
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,890
And it's gone perfect, so that all works as expected.

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,810
So in the next section, my goal is to take all of this logic that we've just figured out.

46
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:03,700
Maybe just make sure all works and we'll build a file system agnostic file upload tool as part of celebrities,

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,730
which will make uploading files really, really easy for any project that's using our celebrities package.

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,340
And we'll get started on that in the next election.
