00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,890
So now that we have all the functions completed, our S3 file system, let's connect it to celebrities,

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,140
so I'm back in the files.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,120
Larry Telesco at the root level of the Celebrity House project near the bottom of that file in the function

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,830
called Create File Systems.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,880
And I'll put it right here after I declare the file system variable doesn't matter where it goes.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,270
So once again, I'm going to check for the presence of a value in my thought on file to determine whether

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,110
or not to try to instantiate an S3 file system.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:37,050
So if O's don't get on and I'm going to look for S3 key, that's as good as any.

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,430
So if that is not equal to an empty string, then I want to create this file system.

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,720
So I'll create a variable S3, and I'll make that equal to the type S3 file system, which it should

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,570
find for me S3 and populate its fields.

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,910
So we have the key, and that's OK.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,810
Don't get on.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,270
S3 underscore key right there.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,750
I'll duplicate this, and the second field will be the secret like that.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,450
And that's S3 secret duplicated again.

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,240
The next one is the region and that is S3 region

18
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,380
and duplicate that.

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,740
The next one is the end point, and that's S3 endpoint and the final one is the bucket.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,440
What's the bucket name?

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,930
And that is S3 bucket.

22
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,530
And then I add that to my file system is a variable file systems at the key of S3, and that's equal

23
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,100
to S3.

24
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,440
OK, so that should take care of that.

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,620
And the next step, of course, is to actually go create a bucket somewhere out in a remote system and

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,500
then fill in the appropriate values in my own file.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
And we'll do that in the next lecture.
