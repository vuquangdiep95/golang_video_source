1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:06,460
So before we go over to GitHub and set up our secrets and key and all that sort of thing, let's set

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,680
up the routes necessary to hook our handlers up to the appropriate URLs that are offering.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,410
So if you look at log in, check those two buttons that we have here have very similar URLs.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:25,180
It's slash off slash GitHub and then some query parameter, and this one is slash author slash Google

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,380
and then a query parameter.

6
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,630
So let's go over to our roots file.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,100
Let's add a couple of routes here, so we'll add, first of all, the one that the button is hooked

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,460
up to.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,330
So we'll put in eight app operates Dot, and yet this is what happens when they click on the button

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,520
and the URL is slash off.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:50,410
And then some provider, then we could just use Cheez Placeholder like that so that URL will link to

12
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,630
a dot handler's dot social plugin.

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,920
OK.

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,890
And then of course, we need one for the callback when we go or take it off to GitHub, GitHub authenticates

15
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,110
users and calls back to some.

16
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,570
You are up.

17
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,379
So that's 8Ot app dot roots.

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,010
Don't get.

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,640
And it's a get request, do you think it was a post request, but apparently it's not slash off slash

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,840
and then provider again and then just slash colbeck.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,430
And that is connected to Adolf Handler's social media callback like that?

22
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,640
OK, now before too long, we'll be adding another route here to log users out.

23
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,640
But for right now, we can just work with these two and try logging people in.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,450
All right.

25
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,160
So the next step is to go over to GitHub and set up the appropriate things to get a key and a secret.

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,890
And we'll start that in the next lecture.
