1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,110
So as I did last time before I test this, I'm going to delete the one value I have in the database,

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,029
so my users table is empty.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:14,600
OK, then I'll come back and open my terminal and I'll stop the application and I'll start the application.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,420
And this should compile without any difficulty.

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,210
Here we are.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,750
It's running.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,170
I go back to my Web browser and reload this page just to make sure everything is absolutely current.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,070
There we go.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,110
And now I'll try logging in with Google.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,120
As you can see now, I'm not logged in.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,290
And if you are, log out first, OK, so I'll log in with Google and I'll choose my Gmail account.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,970
And I'm logged in.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,140
Yes, I am.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,730
And I'll look in my lawn file just to make sure everything is as it should be.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,500
So back to my terminal looks good.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,300
OK, now let's log it.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,030
Users log at.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,050
Now, let's go back and look at our log file.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,940
No errors here, everything seems to be going as it should.

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,540
OK.

21
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,680
And now I'll try logging in again, and it should actually just take me back to the authentication screen,

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,590
the consent screen.

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,070
OK.

24
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,760
And everything seems to work as expected, and we'll sleep better at night knowing that token is revoked.

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,770
I may not have to do that, but as I said, I'm a bit paranoid when it comes to authentication and security.

26
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,970
All right, let's move on to the next section of the course.
