1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,530
So the next step is to go over to GitHub and get her key and her secret and that sort of thing, so

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,860
we can actually try out logging in and then add that information to our on file.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,340
So I'll go to my web browser and I'll go to GitHub dot com and make sure I'm logged in and then I'll

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,730
go up here to the top right and click on my profile or icon and go all the way down to settings.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,440
And that takes me to a long list of possible menu items here, and then what I want is near the bottom.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,250
And it's called developer settings, so I'll click on that.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,900
And there are three things here.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,180
GitHub apps, we're not using that, OK?

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,030
We're not going to build an app for an iPhone or Android device.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,080
We want an off app because we're using authentication and you will click new or app.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,710
And you can see I have several here that I was use for testing and so forth.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,540
I've already created one.

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,340
You cook a new one and we'll ask you some questions and you would just want to authenticate using a

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:56,970
web page.

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,820
And when it comes up, it'll look something like this.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,390
OK.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,300
And what you're going to do is generate a secret, and it may have a default secret here, depending

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,620
on how your account is set up.

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,950
But if doesn't just generate a new client secret, so we get two things we need here.

20
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,790
The first one is this our client ID.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,780
I'm going to copy that.

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,710
I'm going to switch back to my I.D. and I'm going to open the doors on file in my app, so I'll open

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,510
doors in my app.

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,980
I'll go to the very bottom of the file here and I'll add a new entry.

25
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,960
And the first one is going to be called GitHub.

26
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,400
Make sure you spell this right.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,100
GitHub underscore key.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,350
And that's the value I just copied.

29
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:37,920
OK.

30
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,110
And then we'll have GitHub.

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,060
Try that again.

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,310
Git Hub underscore secret.

33
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,670
I'm not going to show you my secret because I don't want to reset it, but I'll put it in there in a

34
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,970
minute.

35
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,160
While you're not watching and then GitHub underscore callback.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,850
Now, if you recall, these three values are read by our application when it's when it creates the providers

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,710
list for Gothe.

38
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,170
OK.

39
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,430
So my callback, I can put that in here.

40
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:15,150
It's a deep colon slash slash local host port four thousand so colon four thousand slash auth slash,

41
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,560
GitHub slash callback and double or triple.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,960
Check your typing to make sure you don't have any typos in there.

43
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,350
OK.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,900
So those are the three values.

45
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,830
Now you only have to come over here and get your client secret.

46
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,870
I can't see mine anymore because it's protected that way, and I can't delete it until I generate a

47
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,230
new one.

48
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,180
But I already have mine copied and put into a secure password manager, so I have it and I'm going to

49
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,530
put that in there.

50
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,600
So once you have all that set up up here, you're going to have to give your application a name and

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,570
give it a home page URL and its callback URL.

52
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,940
And you can put that in here exactly as you have it in your development application.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,770
And of course, when you go live, you would change that to a different URL, one that presumably is

54
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,390
using GPS and doesn't begin with the word local host for development.

55
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,100
This will work perfectly.

56
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,660
So get that all set up.

57
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:14,910
Make sure you put your secret over here in your own file and just check the typing very carefully to

58
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,590
make sure you have everything right because one little typo will make sure that nothing actually works.

59
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,950
OK, so once you have that set up, it's time to try logging in and we'll do that in the next lecture

60
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,240
and see what we got wrong.
