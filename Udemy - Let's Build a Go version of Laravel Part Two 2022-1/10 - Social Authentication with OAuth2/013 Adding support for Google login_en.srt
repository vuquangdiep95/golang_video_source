1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,620
So let's implement this similar sign on functionality for Google.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,500
And you do that, of course, on the Google Cloud platform.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,750
Let me go to the dashboard.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,660
So if you don't have an account here, you can create one for free that just Google, the Google Cloud

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,940
platform and create an account.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,040
And then, of course, you'll create a project I call mine blender because I haven't had to call it

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,000
something right here.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,640
So create a new project if you don't have one.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
And then, of course, you want to find the.

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,070
Both consent screen right here, OK?

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,760
And once you've got to the oath consent screen part.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,890
You're going to want some credentials because without credentials, you can't actually do anything,

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,230
so over here on the left hand side, you'll see credentials, create some and you'll create some new

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:49,800
credentials.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:57,250
Now I created some already and they're listed right here, and what you want are Oath 2.0 client IDs

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,650
and the one I want right here.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,430
So I have this one.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,850
And in here, you need to specify a few things.

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,270
And the way that Google handles things is a little bit different than the way that GitHub handles things.

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,420
So on GitHub, we're only allowed to have one callback URL or, as Google calls it, an authorized redirect

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,870
URL.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,330
So of course, in development, you create one set of credentials for development and in production,

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,180
you just go to GitHub and create new credentials with a different callback URL, and you use that one

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,780
for production.

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,740
But Google allows you to have multiple you arise here, so you create one for a live site like this.

26
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,930
And one here like for development.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,220
And this is the one we're going to use.

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,560
And I've already entered mine and you should enter something pretty much identical to what I have right

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:43,890
here.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,580
OK.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,740
And then up here you have your client ID and you have your client's secret.

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,370
OK.

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,920
And these are the things you're going to need to pay attention to.

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,130
Now there's no point in you trying to use this because I'm going to revoke this particular Client ID

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,000
and secret once this course is over.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,960
Just go create your own mind will be useless to you in any case, because they won't exist by the time

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
you take this course.

38
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,620
But in any case, this is the information I need.

39
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,710
So I'm going to copy this big item here to start with.

40
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:24,880
Client ID and I'm going to switch back to my I.D. and I'm going to open my dot on the file and I'll

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,380
put three entries in here for Google.

42
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,350
Google underscore key will be equal to that value.

43
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:30,490
One.

44
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,610
Just copy, OK.

45
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:41,640
And Google underscore secret, let's go copy that and spark over here in my web browser.

46
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,650
The secret, I'll copy that value.

47
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,180
Paste it in here.

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,510
And get rid of the extra spaces, because that will mess things up.

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,170
And the last failure I need is Google underscore callback.

50
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:07,280
And that will be equal to a cheap, clean slash slash local host port, four thousand slash or slash

51
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,860
Google slash callback.

52
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,410
OK, so that gets the necessary values into our account.

53
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,790
And as I've said, I'll just say it again to avoid any potential confusion down the road.

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,580
Anything you see here next to GitHub qui secret and callback or Google key in secret?

55
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,370
These are my values, and they exist only while I'm creating this course.

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,930
And as soon as this course is over, I'm going to regenerate keys and have entirely new values and these

57
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,850
won't work anymore.

58
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,950
So don't try to use mine because it just won't work for you.

59
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,910
Initially, I said I was going to hide my GitHub secret, but after thinking it over.

60
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,740
That's actually not right because it undoubtedly appeared on the screen for a frame or two at some point

61
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,540
during this course, and it takes 10 seconds to generate new keys.

62
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,690
So I'm going to do that.

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,260
OK.

64
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,250
All right.

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,130
We'll move on and start modifying our code to support Google in the next.
