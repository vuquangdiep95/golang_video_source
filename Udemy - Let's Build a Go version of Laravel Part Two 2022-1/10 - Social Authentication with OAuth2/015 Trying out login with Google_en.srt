1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,650
So let's try logging in with Google and see if we got everything right.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,680
So the first thing I'm going to do is make sure my Docker images are running and mine are.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,580
And then I'm going to log on to my database with my favorite Postgres client, look at the user's table

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,750
and just make sure it's empty.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,970
I deleted the one entry that was in here before this lecture started, just so I know I'm starting from

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,980
a known location or known status.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,690
Then I'll open my terminal window and type, make stop and clear the screen and make start.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,290
And it looks like I have to do a go get, which is no problems long copy that

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,220
and paste it here.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,960
We have to do that once in a while when we're working with multiple packages at the same in the same

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,440
project.

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,640
And I will type start.

13
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,050
So my application is running.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,840
Let me go to my Web browser and I'll go to the home page just to make sure everything is current, go

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,570
to users, log in and I'll try logging in with Google and this should take me to the Google authentication

16
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:07,960
screen.

17
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:16,900
And it does, and I'm going to log in using this account and I logged now in theory.

18
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,980
There it is.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,950
And if I go back to my database, we should see that I have my Gmail account, my first name and my

20
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,550
last name.

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,210
And we do everything looks great, so that works really well.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,510
So the next step is to implement logging out of Google because I can come up here and choose a log out

23
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,800
once again logging out.

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,360
And then if I click Log in with Google, it takes me out again.

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,090
Now it appears that that might have worked.

26
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,630
But you know what?

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,130
I'm not an optimist, so I'm actually going to make sure that I manually call Google's API and say,

28
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,640
revoke that token because I just don't trust it.

29
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,040
It didn't work with GitHub, and it's not very difficult to implement.

30
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,930
So we'll take care of that in the next election.
