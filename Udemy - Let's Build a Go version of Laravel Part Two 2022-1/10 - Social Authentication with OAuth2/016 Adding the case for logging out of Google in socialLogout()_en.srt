1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:07,070
So as I said last time, it appears that the logging out using Gothic, that the logo for Google actually

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,700
logs are set.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,560
But it just appears that way, and I am not an optimist.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,370
I always air on the side of caution.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,660
So here are not handlers go in the function social logout.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,520
I'm going to go all the way down to the case for Google, and I'll implement it, and it's just a very

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,750
few lines of code.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,160
So the first thing I need to do is to get the token from the session, and I can just copy this code

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,970
from up here.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,110
So I'll copy this.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,600
From the case for GitHub and pasted here, now I have the token, and literally logging out of Google

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:48,100
manually is as simple as ignoring the return value, checking for an error and calling HDP right from

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,730
the standard library post form right there.

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,440
And that requires a URL.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:03,880
So we'll use formatting as printout and the format string is GPS colon slash slash accounts dot Google,

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,680
which I got to spell right?

17
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:17,740
Dot com slash oh slash oh off to slash revoke with a question mark and a placeholder and a substitution

18
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,300
for that placeholder is the token.

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,650
OK.

20
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,920
And we pass nil as a second parameter like that, and that should do it for us there.

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,910
Now let's check for an error.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,660
If error is not equal to nil, then we'll just say H Dot App Dialog Dot Print Line and we'll print out

23
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:48,310
error logging out of Google and we'll follow the arrow and that should take care of it.

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,990
OK, now as far as I can tell, this should absolutely work, so we'll give it a try in the next lecture

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,860
and then move on.
