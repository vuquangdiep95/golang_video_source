00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,380
So let's make the changes needed to implement logging in with Google, and we'll just worry about logging

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,200
in for this lecture and worry about logging out in a bit.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,380
So right now, if you go over to your web browser and you have your application running this button

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,650
on the log in screen, logging with Google that appears in this file logging chat.

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,670
And it's this button right here with the label log in with Google and the route for that is slash auth

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,370
slash Google with some query parameter and then our roots file.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,490
We already have that route covered right here that calls social logging because the provider bit in

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,020
curly braces can be anything.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,460
So let's go over to social logging.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,300
And here we grab the query parameter.

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,330
We store its value in the session.

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,490
And then we call in its social off.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,970
And here this is where we need to uncomment scope and specify what kind of information we want to get

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,470
from the log in with Google.

15
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,489
And it's a bit different than it is with GitHub, but it's still a slice of strings.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,460
In this case, we want to get email, which we absolutely have to have.

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,000
And we also want to get the profile just so we can get the users first and last name.

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,170
And then we need to add that a provider here in the U.S provider's method.

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,560
So we'll change this one from GitHub to Google.

20
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,760
I just duplicated that line to say some typing, and we don't want the GitHub key.

21
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,920
We want the Google key.

22
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,020
So we'll get that from the dot on file.

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:41,530
And same way we'll get the Google secret and the Google call back, and we'll change the scope here

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,250
to scope.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,430
And that really should be it.

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,470
So now we should have a means of logging in using Google because there's nothing else required here.

27
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,800
When we get down to the social media, colbeck bid instead of getting the value of first name and last

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:05,690
name by exploding user name, instead, we just get the value right from user first name of new user.

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:13,560
The first name is equal to G User Dot, first name and new user.

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,900
The last name comes from User Dot, the last name and there shouldn't be anything else required.

31
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,550
So in the next lecture, we'll try logging in and see what we got wrong.
