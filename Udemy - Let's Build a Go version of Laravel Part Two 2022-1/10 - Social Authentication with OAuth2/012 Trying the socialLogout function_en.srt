1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,700
So let's see if we got everything right.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,130
Right now, we have our logout function and that's called when someone chooses, log in from the dropdown

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,990
menu on the web app and that will of course, delete a remember token if it exists.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,460
And then it calls social logout.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,460
And that is the one that will actually check to see if social provider exists in the session.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,090
If it doesn't, it just returns.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,200
And if it does, then in our case it should call GitHub API.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,750
Let's see if we got everything right.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,840
So I'm going to stop my application, make stop and restart.

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,130
It may start and I should still be logged in because I haven't logged in yet and my token doesn't expire

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:38,970
for 30 days.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,320
So everything compiled.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:47,110
Let's go back to our Web browser, and I'll just refresh the page to make sure its current look under

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,160
the user's menu.

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,030
There's my log in.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,250
But first, I'll go to off on GitHub.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,410
Refresh this page.

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,830
I have one user right now and I'll go back to my application and I'll try logging it and see if I got

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,190
it right.

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,770
OK, so I've logged out in my log out button or menu item is gone, so that's good.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,280
But now let's go refresh this page over on GitHub.

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,070
We have zero users, and now if I try to log in.

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,960
It takes me back and asked me to reauthorize Perfect.

24
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,150
Now, just so, you know, the only reason I don't have to enter my username and password here is because

25
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,430
I'm already logged in to GitHub and another window.

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,140
And that's still active.

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,480
But if I do this back and forth, back and forth, logging in and logging out eventually, and it doesn't

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,290
take very long.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,860
GitHub will say there have been an awful lot of requests to authenticate for your account, so I'm going

30
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,990
to ask you to enter your password in right now.

31
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,970
And that's just, you know, what's going on here.

32
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,520
All right, so let's move on and implement some of the similar functionality for Google.
