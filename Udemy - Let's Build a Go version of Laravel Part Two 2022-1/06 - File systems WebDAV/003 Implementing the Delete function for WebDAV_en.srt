00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,420
So this time around, we want to implement the delete function for a Web file system, so I'm still

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,940
in the file WebDAV don't go in the folder, WebDAV file systems in the folder, file systems in the

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,050
projects hilarious.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,390
And as usual, the first thing I need to do is to come down here in this function and get a client.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,400
So client is assigned the value of calling W. Don't get credentials.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,200
And now I have a client and all I have to do is to range through that slice of strings that we receive

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,530
as a parameter to this function.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:37,440
So for ignore the index, but pay attention to the item, and that's populated by calling range items

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:37,860
to delete.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,500
And we just delete each item one at a time.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,140
So we'll check for error and that's assigned the value of calling from our client.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,990
The method remove and we're removing item.

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,100
And of course, we need to check for an error, not read.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,300
Dear is remove.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:55,680
That's better.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,900
And we check for an error.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,430
If the error is not equal to nil, then we'll return false.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,980
And again, you can return an error here if you want to.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,950
So that takes care of the method.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,660
Now, of course, we're not finished.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,770
We need to go over to make this work in our code to our handlers, file in the Miami project and find

22
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,990
the delete function, which is here somewhere.

23
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,290
I guess I missed it.

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,480
Where's delete?

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:35,380
Billy, from first right here, and all I needed to do is to copy this and paste it here.

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:48,600
And change this to WebDAV and change this to WebDAV, I spelled them both right, and now we change

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,860
the casting from S&P to WebDAV file system.

28
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,870
Scott WebDAV.

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,750
And that should take care of it.

30
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,330
OK, now we won't test this right now, we'll test it when we finish the last function, which is over

31
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,110
here in WebDAV.

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,770
Don't go.

33
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,410
The the function named get the one that's not used very often, but it's nice to have when you need

34
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,660
it, and we'll take care of that in the next lecture.
