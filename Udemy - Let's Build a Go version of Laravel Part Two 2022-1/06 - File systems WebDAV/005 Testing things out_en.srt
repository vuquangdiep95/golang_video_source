1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,820
So before we can try out our new Web Deb file system, we obviously have to let celebrities know that

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,810
it exists.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,160
So I'm back in the file.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,420
Celebrities don't go in the Celebrity House package and near the bottom of that file.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,860
We have this function, create file systems and we already have Mineo here and we have SFTP.

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,290
So let's add and I'll do so by copying this and modifying it.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,770
Let's add our web to our system.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:34,060
So again, we'll do a check here, and my simple check will be if the entry in the dot on file named

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,590
WebDAV Dot host.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,790
If that's not equal to nothing, though, assume I'm going to be having a web dev file system.

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:49,510
So obviously I'm going to create a type web dev file systems dot WebDAV and I'll name the variable WebDAV.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,600
The name this one.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,500
WebDAV.

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,420
And give it the key web dev in all caps.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,250
And that only has three required fields.

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:10,600
Port is part of host, so I just need to change this to Web Dev and the same thing for the next two

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,950
WebDAV host, WebDAV user and WebDAV Pass.

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,950
OK, so that's the first thing we have to do.

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,440
The second thing we have to do is to update the handlers in our Maya project that don't know about WebDAV

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,120
and right now delete from file system.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,990
Does we did that in the last lecture, I think, but this one post upload to FS does not.

22
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,890
And this one's going to cause us a bit of grief, but I'll talk about that when we try that.

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:49,570
So let me paste that in here and modify this to say WebDAV and modify this to get the key WebDAV from

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:57,130
the map and cast it to the correct type, which is WebDAV file system web death.

25
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,380
OK, so that one's done, and I think the last one is listing the file system, which is up here somewhere.

26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,190
Yeah, right here.

27
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:11,590
So we'll copy this one in the function named List EF-S and make sure you don't copy that closing curly

28
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,220
bracket or you'll have problems and we'll make this WebDAV

29
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,060
and make this web dev and this web dev.

30
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,400
And this one gets converted to WebDAV file system.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,180
Dark Web Dev.

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:28,990
OK.

33
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,160
So those are the changes.

34
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,550
Now, make sure you have your Docker images running or the next steps won't work at all.

35
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,630
Then open your terminal.

36
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,360
Make sure you're in the right directory, the my app directory I am now, when I type make start, it's

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,170
going to work for me.

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,300
When you type it, it's probably going to give you an error message saying you need to go get the WebDAV

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,270
file system from whatever your calling your to project.

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,510
So just copy the go get command pasted into the terminal hit return and then type make start.

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,710
Mine should start up.

42
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,960
And it did.

43
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:15,240
So let's go over to our web browser and let's go to localhost four thousand or whatever reports you're

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,900
listening to.

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,690
And let's go to the file systems.

46
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,480
And first of all, let's try listing the files on the file system.

47
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,550
So let's make sure that minerals still works.

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,780
It does.

49
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,980
Let's try WebDAV and see what's up on the server there now.

50
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,450
And I currently have one file, and that should be exactly the same thing that I have on SFP, and I

51
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,050
work perfectly.

52
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,170
OK, so let's try deleting that using Web Dev.

53
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,910
So I'll list my web dev.

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,380
There's my, well, big.

55
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,430
I'll delete that.

56
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,780
And it's now gone, so that worked, so let's try uploading something.

57
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,360
And here's where we may run into a problem because Murphy's Law says if something can go wrong, it

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,750
will.

59
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,420
And in this case, it seems to be absolutely accurate because there are currently appears to be a bug

60
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:10,280
in either the SFTP go, the server we're connecting to or in the WebDAV client, because sometimes when

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,450
I upload to a web dev file system, sometimes I get an error 400, which isn't very helpful, but let's

62
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:17,810
try it.

63
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,990
I'll put up meta JPEG and see what happens.

64
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,370
And I got my error 400, and that's the only error it's giving me.

65
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:33,920
But if I log in to my SFP server using the username SFTP and the password password, I'm connecting

66
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,340
to localhost port 80 80 when I log in.

67
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,300
There's nothing there.

68
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,480
So let's go back.

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,240
Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.

70
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's try choosing a different file.

71
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,190
Say, well, big and uploading that.

72
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,200
OK.

73
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,750
And now come back in here and refreshing this.

74
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,920
And there it is.

75
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,140
So there's a bug there right now, and what's happening is sometimes I'm getting an error back and sometimes

76
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,650
I'm not.

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,620
So for the purposes of this course, the easiest thing to do is simply wait for the fix to be applied

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,540
to either the client or the server.

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,140
But there is a bug there and it's one that apparently is being looked at.

80
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,790
So I'm not going to lose too much sleep about it because I know that I've written the code correctly.

81
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,200
And if you really want to make this work, you can simply go back to your code here and find the Post

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,440
Upload to FS Bid, which is down here.

83
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,970
Post Upload FS.

84
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,120
You could simply have this return, no error and comment out there.

85
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,470
So put a blank identifier there just the underscore and comment this out, and that would get you past

86
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,000
the bug that currently exists in my file system, but I don't think it's critical for our purposes.

87
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,430
We can simply wait for the bug to be fixed.

88
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,190
And chances are, most people are not going to be using WebDAV to put files up in any case.

89
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,670
And the reason I included it was just to show you how easy it can be to have multiple file systems.

90
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,040
So I'm going to let that one go for right now.

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,370
And when they've actually fixed the code for either the server or the client, I'll update this lecture.

92
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,210
But in the meantime, things seem to be working more or less as they should.

93
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,440
OK.

94
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:22,520
We'll move on in the next section to using Amazon's library for connecting to S3 buckets.
