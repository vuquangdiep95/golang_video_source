1
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:04,450
So before we can do much coding, we need to set up our project.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,820
And if you look at the course resources for this lecture, you'll see a file called Source Dot Zip.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,190
Download that and then create a new folder somewhere on your machine.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,980
It doesn't matter where you put it, as long as you can find it easily.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:26,160
I created a folder called Cell Dash Dev and then extract the contents of that zip file into that folder,

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,210
and you should wind up with a folder named something like Cel Dash Dev your overall folder.

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,730
And inside of that, you have a folder called celebrities.

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:41,020
Now, if you did the first part of this, this creating a go version of Laravel, you probably already

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,390
have some source code that you could use if you wanted to.

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,910
But I encourage you to use Source Dot Zip, download that and use it instead.

11
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,950
And then you can apply whatever changes you want to your own code as you go along or after you're finished

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,850
this course or whatever.

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,790
But it will be simpler for everyone if we're all starting from the same place.

14
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,220
So I encourage you to do that.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,280
And once you've done it, once you have an overall project folder and inside of that folder, name celebrities

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,350
with all the appropriate source code in there and start up visual studio code or whatever your favorite

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,370
editor is, and open that folder the celebrities folder.

18
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:22,530
So I'll open from my desktop or find my cell dash dev and open celebrities.

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,270
OK.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,900
And I'll open it now.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,060
This is the code as it existed at the end of part one of this course.

22
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:39,910
So if you look for example at the make file right here down here on Line 18, this is how we build the

23
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,820
celebrity's executable and we're going to do that in just a moment, but I need to make one change first.

24
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:52,330
So if you go to the CMT Seelye folder and find the new Dot Go file and open that.

25
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,420
This is the line right here that I want to change.

26
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:03,280
When I did the first half of this course, I used C to get the necessary skeleton's hilarious application

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,390
repository, and I'm going to change that to use TDPs instead.

28
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:16,780
So what I'm going to do is just duplicate this line, comment the first one out and change the URL to

29
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,470
this.

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,970
I have a copy to my clipboard.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,620
We're using HTTPS instead.

32
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,490
And as you can see, the URL is pretty, pretty similar, but it's HTP s colon slash slash GitHub dot

33
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,290
com slash t Solr slash celebrities dash app dot get.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,950
OK.

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,690
So that's the first change I want to make.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,480
Now, once that's done, I'm going to go to my terminal window and I'll just type make build.

37
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,450
And this will build a new version of the celebrity's application inside the this directory.

38
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,210
So now if I go inside the this directory, I can type dot slash celebrities.

39
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:57,340
And if you're on windows, it'll have Dot X at the end, of course, new and I'm going to create an

40
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,530
application folder called my app and please use the name my app for now.

41
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,360
This will clone the repository and everything is ready to go.

42
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,890
OK, so now I have a new application inside that folder.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,750
So over here, if I go back to my finder or my desktop inside of celebrities inside of the dist, I

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,000
have a new folder called my app, and I want that to exist beside this hilarious folder.

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:34,010
So from the command line, I can just say move my app up one level that gets me inside the celebrity

46
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,560
folder, then up another level which gets me beside the celebrities folder, I think.

47
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,220
Let's find out.

48
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,540
So I'll go up to levels and do an else.

49
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,870
And there they are.

50
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,850
Now we're not quite done.

51
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,110
Let's close this window entirely or just create a new window that'll do the trick.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,470
And let's open that celebrity's folder.

53
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,450
So I will make this window bigger.

54
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,800
What we're going to do here is create a new workspace in a minute and I'll open that my app folder I

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,430
just created.

56
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,920
So on my desktop, inside a cell, dev my app, I'm going to open this.

57
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:16,459
And then I'm going to open go dark mode, and I want to add the replace line that we used last time

58
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:16,839
around.

59
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:25,040
So at the very bottom of this file, I'll simply add a line that tells Go, we're going to replace GitHub

60
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,840
dot com slash t Solr slash celebrity's

61
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,840
version zero point zero point zero, which I don't think matters, but I was at it with dot dot slash

62
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:47,450
celebrities and say that, OK, now I'm going to close this window and close this window and create

63
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,230
a new window.

64
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,750
And then I will say add a folder to a workspace.

65
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,070
Now I'll add those two folders that we just created on my desktop.

66
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,620
Cell Dev.

67
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:07,420
I'm going to add celebrities and I'm also going to add another folder to the workspace.

68
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:17,130
Which is my app that now if I look at my files, you'll see I have my app here.

69
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,540
I have celebrities there.

70
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:28,020
And now I will save everything as a workspace safe workspace as and I'll put that at the root level

71
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,020
of my cell dev folder, which I'll call just workspace.

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,430
OK, now that we've done this, it will make it much easier for us to work on our project because I'll

73
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,670
be able to make changes in celebrities and have them reflected very quickly, much faster than last

74
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,180
time around.

75
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,160
Because the last time I tried this, when I recorded the first half of this course, this didn't work.

76
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,330
But it appears to now, OK, so we have our workspace set up.

77
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,500
Let's move on.
