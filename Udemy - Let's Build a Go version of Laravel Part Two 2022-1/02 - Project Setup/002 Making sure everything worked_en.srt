1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,380
Before we go too much further, let's just make sure that everything works.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,560
So I'm going to start up Visual Studio code right here, and I will say open a workspace.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,280
From a vial, and I'll find my workspace, which is inside my desktop folder right here, workspace,

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,000
that one.

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,920
So we have it open.

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,170
And the first thing I want to do is I want to make sure that it actually works, so opened my terminal,

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,740
make sure I'm inside the My App folder and I am.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,300
And I'll just take make start.

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,620
OK, so it started it on Port 4000.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,730
Let's go to our Web browser and make sure we can actually hit that file so localhost four thousand perfect.

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,430
So it works.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,100
Now let's stop the application.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,300
Make stop.

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,180
And let's make sure that if we make a change here in celebrities, that it's reflected when we use that

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,150
change in my app, and we can do that by going to the celebrity folder and creating a new folder inside

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,630
of that cold test folder and inside of that look pretty good file.

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,150
And I'll just call it test, go go.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,540
And the package is test folder.

19
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,410
And I'll just create a handler here, func test handler.

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,960
And it takes the standard two arguments for any handler, a response writer, which I'll call W Response

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,330
Writer and a pointer to a request which I'll call our HIPAA request and I'll just write some text to

22
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,320
the browser window so you don't write as a slice of bytes.

23
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,070
It works.

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,090
That's enough.

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,850
OK, so that exists now.

26
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,450
If I go to the Roots Dog Go file inside of my app right here and I add a test route.

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,100
Read like this a dog get test route.

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,810
And I want that to point to the new package called Test Folder inside of celebrities.

29
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,890
So I should be able to just to go test folder dot test handler.

30
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,260
OK?

31
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,990
And it looks like it worked really quickly for me.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,820
Sometimes there's a few seconds of delay, but down here in my terminal now I should be able to able

33
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,260
to type make start.

34
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,700
And it's now running, and I can go back to my web browser and try going to this route.

35
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:46,240
So I switch back to Firefox and I'll click on my user over and paste that to the end of it.

36
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:54,250
And it works great that is ever so much faster than the old way of doing it, the way I was forced to

37
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,920
do it in the previous section of this course.

38
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,810
So that'll make our lives a lot easier.

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,470
OK, so now that we know that everything works, let's get rid of this test route and get rid of this

40
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,280
test package.

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,770
Delete that and move to trash.

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,770
And we're good to go and I I'll stop the application.

43
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,490
Make stop.

44
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,570
All right.

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,080
Let's go do some actual work on our project and we'll get started with file systems in the next section

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,740
of this course.
