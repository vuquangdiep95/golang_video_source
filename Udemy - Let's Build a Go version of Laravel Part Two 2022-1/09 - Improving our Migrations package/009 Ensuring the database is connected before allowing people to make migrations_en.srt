1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,840
So let's take care of this last to do item here in make don't go inside the Seelye folder, inside the

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,850
CMGI folder in the Celebrity House project, and what we want to do here is to make sure that the database

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:13,420
is set up.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:20,290
Now that means having a valid entry or at least having some kind of entry in your own files specifying

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,010
your database.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,550
And it also means we're going to have to have a file in a folder called config at the root level of

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,570
our application.

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,850
So a config folder inside of that's something called Database Wiimote.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,800
And that's the configuration file that popped needs.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,260
So we can just do it like this.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,360
We'll say we'll call a function.

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,320
We'll just call function.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,220
That doesn't exist yet.

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,320
Check for DB.

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,100
OK.

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:53,440
And if I go over to the helper file, which is inside me CMD Seelye folder right there, I'll put it

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,640
right before the help text.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,460
I'll create a function here called func check for DV.

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,100
Now what are we going to do in here?

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,850
Well, we know our database type is read by celebrities when it reads the dot on file, so db Typekit

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,520
and that's assigned the value of year.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,060
This is just to make it readable.

23
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,700
Selden DB Dot data type.

24
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,480
OK.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,920
So we'll say here, we'll say if DB type is equal to an empty string.

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:30,130
They didn't specify anything in there on file, so we'll say exit gracefully and we'll give it an error.

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,480
Errors dot new.

28
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:41,800
And the textual pudding is simply no database connection provided in dorms.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,550
OK, so that's our first check.

30
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:52,690
The second check is to see if the file database requirement exists in the applications config folder.

31
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,830
So we'll say, if not, file exists.

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:05,230
And the file we want to check is at the root path of the application spelled out repass plus configuration

33
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,790
database requirement.

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,750
So if that doesn't exist, then exit gracefully.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,540
And the error this time is errors York-New.

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:21,430
Then we'll just say configuration database dot why HTML does not exist.

37
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,930
OK, so now we're checking for database, and that was pretty straightforward.

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,330
Now, while we're at it, let's scroll down here and update our help text because it's no longer make

39
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,520
migration name.

40
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,690
It's make migration name and then format, which means are going to hit the spacebar a bunch of times.

41
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,350
So things line up properly do that fast enough.

42
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,090
I'm sure there's a faster way to do this, but I can't recall where it is right now.

43
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,590
And they will change to help text creates two new up and down migrations in the migrations boulder.

44
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:22,660
Semicolon format equals, and then we'll put sequel or fused default theories.

45
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,820
There should be enough.

46
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,490
OK, so we have that out of the way.

47
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:34,660
And of course, the next step is to actually create that config slash database, start Mel file and

48
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,060
to actually try running some migrations once we create them and we'll get started on that in the next

49
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,450
election.
