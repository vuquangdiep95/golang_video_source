1
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:07,080
So we have the necessary code, we think, in place to generate phase migrations or cycle migrations,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,130
but phase for now.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,900
So let's give this a try.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,680
Now there's a couple of things we have to do here.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,770
We can comment this out and we'll take care of checking to make sure the database is set up in a bit

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,420
and hopefully deleting the unnecessary imports it did.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,090
So there's no error showing up right now.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,610
So I should be able to open my terminal.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,340
Make sure I'm in this hilarious folder.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,020
Clear the screen and say make build, underscore Seelye and actually create a new celerity executable.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,810
And I have something missing here.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,920
So let's go get that.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,330
I will.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,850
Apparently, I have to go get this thing, which I will.

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,260
So let's paste right in there.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,830
Go get it.

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,490
This is one of the problems you run into when you're working with multiple projects in a single project.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,660
Let's try that again.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,490
Make build, underscore Selah.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,210
OK, so it apparently made it so now I can switch to my other tab, where I'm in my celebrity's folder

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,760
and do an last show in my My At folder and do it like special celebrities.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,620
So that was just built moments ago.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,700
Now let's make sure our migrations folder is currently empty, and it is.

24
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,610
So let's try this out, let's say.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,960
Dot slash celebrities make migration test.

26
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,420
And I'll leave it with no final parameter, I could put fizz there, but I'll test it this way first.

27
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,910
Let's see what happens.

28
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,030
It says it's finished.

29
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,360
Let's look at our migrations folder and see what we have.

30
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,140
There's an up migration and that is the correct code.

31
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,670
And here's a down migration.

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,590
And that's the correct code as well.

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,450
So that works really well.

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,570
So let's try making another one.

35
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:09,580
Dot slash celebrities make migration test, too, and this time I'll specify Skull sequel for the last

36
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,030
argument.

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,920
Now, if I come up here, I should have two more.

38
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,660
And they're both school migrations and they should be empty, so he didn't specify anything.

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,320
Perfect.

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:18,950
OK.

41
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:28,460
And now let's try the last cased dot slash celebrities make migration test three is.

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,680
And if I come up here, I should have another one.

43
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:38,100
And it's a phased migration and the up is the correct content and the down is the correct content.

44
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,550
Perfect.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,720
So that seemed to work really well.

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,400
So let's delete these.

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,540
So we're not going to be using them, and I don't want them messing me up later on.

48
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,180
And let's go back and see what we have to do next.

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,270
So back here, my to do comment.

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,190
Make sure the database is set up.

51
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,110
I shouldn't be able to create a migration if there is no database in place.

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,640
The only reason being that someone might create a new project and they decide all too many database

53
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,630
migrations without having set up their database and then migrations get created.

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,520
But every time they try to run them, they get errors.

55
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,740
So we may as well make sure that they do things in the correct order and set up their database before

56
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,680
they try to create migrations, and we'll do that in the next election.
