1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,250
So let's give this a try.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,940
And right now, I have my darker images is running, my Dr. Campos is running up, so I'm able to connect

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,930
to my celebrity's database and I am connected right here, as you can see.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,970
So this is my favorite Postgres client, and I'm looking at the celebrity's database and it has no tables.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,400
It's completely empty, but it exists and it's running and that's critical.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,910
Or what I'm doing next won't work.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,640
So let's go back to my I.D. and the first thing I have to do, obviously is in the celebrity folder

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,290
on the command line in terminal.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,830
I need to run, make, build, underscore Seelye, to build a new version of the executable and put

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,060
it in my app folder.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,110
Then I switch over to my other tab, where I'm in the My App folder.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,330
And let's make a migration so that celebrities make migration.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,080
And I'll call it test, OK, and I should make these migrations up and down.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,430
And in my group, my migrations folder, I now have an app migration, and when I run my migrate command,

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,690
it should create a table named some table with two columns.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, it'll have more than two, but it will have it in some column, at least.

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,120
So let's try that celebrities migrate.

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,180
Well, that's encouraging.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,210
It seemed to run, so let's switch to our database client and refresh this.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,680
And there is the schema migration tables, which is automatically created by pop.

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,150
And here's some cable.

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,760
Now, if I look at it, it has the ID and the some call up, some column color, which is really hard

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,320
to say, and it automatically adds the created and updated out columns as well.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:34,920
Perfect.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,730
So let's go back.

26
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:42,180
So we're not looking at the table and I'll try migrating down that celebrities migrate down.

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,980
And that seemed to work.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,880
So let's go back and look at our database refresh, and I should still have this schema migration table,

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,270
but this one should be gone.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
And it is, so let's migrate back up again.

31
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,690
And now it should be back there when I come back here.

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,380
I should see that some table.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,850
I do.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,880
And let's try that.

35
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,289
Celebrities migrate reset.

36
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,210
And everything should be back where it was, we should have reset our database in effect, and it's

37
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:19,840
perfect.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,320
I accidentally open the catalog, but that all seems to work really well.

39
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,710
So time to move on and just to make sure that other things like make us continue to work the way they're

40
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,650
supposed to and we'll get started on that in the next election.
