1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,170
So now that we've made these changes to the make us command, let's give them a try.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,930
And the first thing I'll do here is just clean up some of this code.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,180
I don't need this comment out stuff anymore.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,620
Inside of off, don't go in this folder.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,570
And remember that when I run this command, it's actually going to die every time.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,860
It can't execute one of these things where I'm copying files from a template.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:31,660
So, for example, I'm going to copy from the template file system templates, data user go text to

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,290
data user go in my out project.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,140
And that means I should make sure I don't have any of the things in there already.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,530
And basically, that's any file that's associated with making the with running we make last minute.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,160
So, for example, I don't have a user's dongo or a token.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,110
Don't go or remember a token, don't go in here.

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:51,700
So that's good.

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,480
I should also check to see what else is copied middleware.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,350
So do I have an off Doug go and middleware Moscow looking middleware?

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:00,850
No, I don't.

17
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,630
So that's good.

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,960
So make sure that you don't have pre-existing copies of these files anywhere in your app project or

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,310
you're just going to have to go delete them and start over from scratch.

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,770
And I've had to do that several times while I was testing things, and you probably don't want to go

21
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,700
through that exercise.

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,040
So once you've verified that, make sure your Docker images are running so your database is running,

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,580
in other words.

24
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,970
And then we'll open our terminal and we'll go over to the celebrities project and we'll run that command,

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,320
make, build, see.

26
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,700
And if everything goes according to plan that should create a new house executable over in the My App

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,050
folder, and it looks like it did.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,980
So now we'll go to the My Apps folder, and I'm in the correct directory and I'll run dot slash celebrities,

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,300
make off and see if it works.

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,710
And hopefully we get everything right.

31
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,840
We almost never do.

32
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,920
But let's give it a try.

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,240
So it looks like it ran properly, it open up our favorite database client and lines right here post

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,630
to come.

35
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,280
And connect to my Docker image right here.

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,640
And it looks like I have a remember token's table.

37
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,640
Some table is leftover from the last time we tested our migrations and there's tokens and there's users,

38
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,660
and that's very good.

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,160
I'm shocked.

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,510
I go buy a lottery ticket.

41
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,680
Things never work right.

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,280
The first try.

43
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,930
Let's make sure we have everything in the correct folders, so we have our off off token.

44
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,220
And remember all inside the middleware.

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:32,950
So that's good.

46
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,790
Do we have anything in our mail?

47
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,470
We have our password reset HTML and plain.

48
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,900
It looks like everything worked the way that it should.

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,320
There's my handlers and they are my data models.

50
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,910
Well, that was a bit shocking, but we now have that working the way that it should.

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,110
So now that we have our make up command working, let's complicate matters by moving on to social authentication

52
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,070
in the next section.
