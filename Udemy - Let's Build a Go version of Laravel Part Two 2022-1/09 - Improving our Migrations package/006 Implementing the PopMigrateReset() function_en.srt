1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:08,270
So the last function we need to implement inside this file migration SCO is the one that resets migrations.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,630
In other words, it runs all the down migrations in reverse order and then runs all the up migrations,

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,890
and it's pretty simple.

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,950
So we'll put it right here just after pop migrate down.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:28,150
We have a function with the receiver of sea pointer to our and we'll call it pop, migrate, reset,

6
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:35,830
and it will just take the T.X our connection a pointer to pop dot connection, and it potentially returns

7
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,160
an error.

8
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,680
And this is dead simple.

9
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:45,130
So once again, we need this information, which I'll copy from run port migrations, migration path

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,030
and a file migrate.

11
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,260
Or so I'll copy that.

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,770
Come back down here, paste them in.

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,660
And now it's as simple as saying error is equal to FM dot reset, and we check for an error.

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,080
If error is not equal to nil return, the error otherwise turned down.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,490
OK, so we have all of these functions now and the next step is to actually try to use them, which

16
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,770
means we'll have to make some modifications to the celebrities command line application and we'll get

17
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,960
started on that in the next lecture.
