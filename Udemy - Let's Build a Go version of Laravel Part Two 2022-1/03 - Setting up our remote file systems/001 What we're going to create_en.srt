00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,650
In this section of the course, we're going to focus upon multiple remote file systems.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,740
And since we're building a sort of clone of Laravel lingo, let's have a look at what they have.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,830
So as you can see, they have the local driver.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,020
I'm just looking in the documentation for Laravel.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,230
They have a local driver, the public disk, they have Amazon buckets and they have other ones as well.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,710
OK.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,970
And here's what we're going to do.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,840
And this is a finished version of what we'll be doing in this section of the course.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,650
And we have a new menu up here which will be adding momentarily.

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,520
We're going to go to the file systems and choose list files.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,910
And from here, we're going to support four different file systems in addition to the local file system.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,460
The first one is an Amazon S3 bucket, so I can choose that and say, show me the files that are on

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,720
that remote file system and then they're OK and we can delete them if we want to.

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,370
I'm not going to right now, but we can.

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,350
So we'll support Amazon S3 buckets and also Mineo, which is a very useful piece of software that allows

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,069
you to create your own Amazon S3 buckets without paying Amazon.

17
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:09,960
So we may as well support that, and it uses its own driver, which is why it's a separate file system.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:18,300
Also, SFD secure FTP protocol that'll work exactly as we expect, and we can treat this as a local

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,440
file system with our code.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,290
And finally, one that's not used a great deal, but I just wanted to show you how to create multiple

21
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,940
file systems using a single type WebDAV, which some people still use.

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,590
And it actually points to the same directory as SFTP because the one will be using supports web dev

23
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,910
and FTP and unsecure FTP, which I refused to implement because it is insecure by default.

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,340
In any case, we'll be able to list things more loss and delete them, and we'll also be able to, of

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,300
course, upload them.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,810
So I'll be able to choose which file system do I want to upload to.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,370
So if I'm choosing, say, SFP, I'll be able to browse for a file, choose something, there's a picture,

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,180
let's upload it.

29
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,450
And now that's been uploaded to FTP and I believe it was called lorem.

30
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,520
Let's see if it's there.

31
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,390
We go to SMTP and list and there is a lorem ping.

32
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,330
Now I can delete it, so I deleted.

33
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,430
Yes, and it's gone.

34
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,580
OK, a fair bit of work to implement all of this, but let's get started in the next election.
