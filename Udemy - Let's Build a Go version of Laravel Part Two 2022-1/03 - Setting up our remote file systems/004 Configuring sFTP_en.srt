00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,970
So we have Mineo configured, and now we need to configure SFP secure FTP, and again, I'm looking

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,880
at my Docker dash composed why EML file inside the My App folder of my workspace?

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,550
And here you can see I'm listening to three parts 80 80, and that's what we're going to in just a moment.

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:25,660
That's where we're going to configure a user to connect to our SFP Service 2022, which is actually

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:33,160
in production that would be Port 22, where that's what you connect to using FTP and one zero zero eight

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,180
zero and in production, that would be 80 or 443 if it was secure.

7
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,010
And we'll be using that port for Web Dev.

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,990
But let's switch over to our web browser.

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,340
And first of all, let me show you the home page for this.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,990
This is a Docker hub, and this is the Docker image we're using to provide FTP services, SFB services.

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,230
And I'll put a link to this in the course resources for this lecture.

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,980
And of course, you can read about that at your leisure.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:07,810
So let's open a new browser tab and go to HDD Collins localhost port 80.

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,210
And the first thing it's going to ask me to do is to create an admin user, so I'll create an admin

15
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,660
user called admin with the password of password.

16
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,420
Again, not something I'd ever do in production, but sufficient for our development purposes.

17
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,830
Now we've created that user, but that's the admin user.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,610
The admin user actually can't connect to SFP, so we need to create a new user.

19
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:38,200
So by default, it takes me to the view and manage user screens while creating new user by clicking

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,980
the plus sign.

21
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,680
Then I'll call this user SFTP with no description.

22
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,010
It's an active user, no expiration date, and I'll give it the password of password.

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,450
So just remember what you use for username and password here, and we're not quite done.

24
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,350
We need to give this user some permissions, and I'm going to give the user right here in the permissions

25
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:06,280
section or select the asterisk the star and make sure that person has all privileges.

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,919
List, upload, download everything we need to do.

27
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:09,550
OK.

28
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,250
And I'm going to change the home dear.

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,090
By default, it would use the home folder that we created in the DB data FTP folder, but I'm going

30
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,710
to change that.

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,860
And if I go back to my Docker, why AML or Docker compose?

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,910
Why AML file?

33
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,920
This is the folder I'm going to use slash M.A. slash data.

34
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,190
Copy that you don't have to, but I'm going to and I'll paste that in here.

35
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:33,850
OK?

36
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,720
And then I school the very bottom and click Save, which is way down here in the lower right hand corner.

37
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,230
Submit.

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,630
So now I have a user I can connect to as well, and that user has no quota.

39
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,750
And again, just as was the case with Mineo, there's all kinds of permissions you can set here and

40
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,710
all kinds of things you can.

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,690
And there's actually a really good package.

42
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,830
If you ever need to set up an SFD server, you might want to use this one.

43
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,590
But in any case, we now have this configured, so it's time to move on to actually writing some code

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,400
for the first time.
