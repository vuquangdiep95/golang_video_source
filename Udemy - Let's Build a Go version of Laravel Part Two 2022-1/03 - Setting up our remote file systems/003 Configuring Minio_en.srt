00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,020
So before we can use Mineo, we need to set a few things up, and fortunately, it's really, really

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,530
easy.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,210
So right here in my Docker compose, don't why HTML file in the Mineo section?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,200
If you look under environment, I have the route user's username set to route and the route user's password

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,960
set to password, which is fine for a local development.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,880
But of course, you'd never do that in production.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,360
So Mineo, let's go over to our web browser.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,689
And first of all, this is the link to the Mineo web page.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,600
And it's pretty easy.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,340
It's min dot i o.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,290
And there's all kinds of documentation, all sorts of things you can look at here and you can buy services

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,130
for them if you wish.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,330
But of course, we're not doing that.

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,220
We're actually going to just open a new tab in our web browser.

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,680
And if I go back to my Docker compose, don't why email, which is right here, you'll see that I'm

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,510
looking at listening to two parts.

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,680
And of course, here in the port section, what's on the left side is my host machine.

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,770
In other words, my computer I'm working on.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,020
And what's on the right side is the port that it's listening to on the back end in the Docker image,

20
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,810
and I want to connect to this port nine zero zero one.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,570
So back in my web browser, I'll simply go to local host code nine zero zero one and that takes me to

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,640
a login screen.

23
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,610
And here I put my username root and my password, which is password, and I'll log in.

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,620
And the first thing I'm going to do.

25
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,750
There's all kinds of things you can do here.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,220
You can configure almost anything you want setting up policies.

27
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,550
I am policies.

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,600
All I want to do right now is create a bucket.

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,270
And I'm going to create a new bucket, which I will call not a very inventive name, but it will suit

30
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,050
my purposes.

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,300
Test bucket all one word.

32
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,660
And I'm going to leave versioning off object blocking off.

33
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,600
Quota off.

34
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,750
We're just going to take the defaults, OK?

35
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,430
And of course, I can't make these changes because I'm using a single desk setup.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,550
One of the nice things about Mineo is I can actually install it on multiple machines in the same data

37
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,449
center and share the disks.

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,960
And that makes sure that my information, my data is available even if one of the servers goes down.

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,810
So I'll say this now.

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,030
I've created something I can connect to and we'll take care of actually connecting to it later on.

41
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,500
Right now, we just want to set it up.

42
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,220
OK, so that one's done.

43
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,260
Next, we have to set up our FTP and we'll do that in the next lecture.
