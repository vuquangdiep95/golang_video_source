1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,870
So before we can work with remote file systems, we obviously need some file systems that we can connect

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,850
to, and we're going to do that using Docker and I presume that you have Docker installed, but if not,

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:19,550
you can go over to this URL, Docker WWE Gawker.com slash products slash Docker Dash desktop.

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,400
And if you hit it on a Mac, you'll see this screen with the two buttons.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,430
Download the one appropriate for your file system or for your computer, and if you're on windows,

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,050
you'll see the download for Windows and Linux and so forth.

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,780
OK, so install that.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,280
Then once you have that installed, go back to your project.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,860
And right now, I'm going to look at the My App folder in this workspace, and let's open up Docker

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,400
compose.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,410
Don't worry, I'm out now.

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,420
There are three services in this in this file right now.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,470
The first one starts Postgres, and it expects to find a folder called DB data at the root level of

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,230
our application, and inside of that a folder called Postgres.

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,080
Now I could create those here.

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:06,560
But one of the really irritating features is if I create an empty folder like clicking over here in

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,690
my app and seeing create a new folder and I can do the first one DB data.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,650
And I need that because I have DB Dash data right here for the mounted volume for this Postgres Docker

19
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,860
container, and I can create one called inside of that a new folder called Postgres, and that works.

20
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,800
But if I create another one, often it creates an inside of Postgres, so I'm going to create the rest

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,490
of them right from my desktop and you can follow whatever procedure works for you.

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,810
We just need these folders.

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,350
OK?

24
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,550
Now, if you go to the course resources for this lecture, you'll see a complete Docker wire ml file

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,700
or Docker Dash composed by EML file that you can download.

26
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,680
But we need a few new services.

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,430
First thing I'll do is comment about MariaDB because I'm not going to be using that.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,040
I'm going to be using Postgres, so I'll comment there.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,950
Then, right underneath Redis.

30
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,300
I'll get a blank line.

31
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,810
Then another blank line, then I'll backspace twice to get to the right column.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,530
And I already have on my clipboard the two new Docker images.

33
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,620
I want to make part of my Docker compose file as well.

34
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,760
Paste them in and you'll get these from the course resources for this lecture.

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,450
So the first thing we're going to have the first new service is one called SFTP, and that will actually

36
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,520
provide both SFTP and WebDAV services.

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,280
And again, that requires two folders inside the DB data folder, one called SFP and one called home.

38
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:38,060
So I'll switch over to my desktop here and I'll open up my DB data folder and create a new folder called

39
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:38,900
FTP.

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,060
And another one called Home.

41
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:48,700
OK, so now if I come back here inside the DB data folder, I don't have home postgres in 150 people.

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,880
Now, the next Docker image that we're including is one called Mineo, and I'll talk about that in a

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,190
minute.

44
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,630
OK.

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,590
Now this one by default listens to two ports 9000, which is the actual service that we can connect

46
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,580
a minute with, and 9001, which is the web interface.

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,780
Now, in my case, I need to change the 9000 to an 8000 just because I already have something running

48
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,880
on Port, 9000 on my system.

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,720
Right now, I actually am being forced to work on a project for a client, so I have the fpm running

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,320
and that's taking up Port 9000, so I'll just use eight thousand instead.

51
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:33,170
And of course, this also wants a folder called Mineo inside the DVD data folder, where it's going

52
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,940
to store its data.

53
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,700
So I'll come back here and create a new folder called Mean I'll.

54
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:38,900
OK.

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,340
So with those changes, I should now be able to start up Docker so my terminal and make sure I'm in

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,320
the correct directory.

57
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:55,820
My app, I am and I'll type Docker compose up dashboard to run it in the background and hopefully everything

58
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,270
will work.

59
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,780
Now that might take you a little bit longer as it pulls the darker images, but it's running now, so

60
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,450
if I go to my doctor desktop right over here the dashboard.

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:18,690
I should see my app running, and it's got all the appropriate services Reddish, SFP, Mineo and Postgres.

62
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,660
Now if I wanted to stop them, I just come down here and typed Docker compose down and that will actually

63
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,200
stop them.

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,760
But I'm going to leave them running right now because in the next lecture, we'll configure accounts

65
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,830
on both Mineo and SFO.

66
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,580
So we'll take care of that in the next lecture.
