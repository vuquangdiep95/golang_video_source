1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,070
So now that we have our handler in progress and presumably at least partially functional, let's create

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:12,190
a route that points to it and try things out, and I'll use this test route in my rootstock go file

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,930
inside my app project.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:21,910
I'll just modify that to point to our handler and strip so aident get and we'll go to and do use this

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,180
for the URL, because that's what is in the templates.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:31,090
We used that you installed a couple of lectures ago and we'll point it to air handlers list f.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:31,420
S.

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,070
And now I should be able to open my terminal and type make start.

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:45,780
And it's going, so let's go over to our Web browser and hit that URL, so I'll go to localhost 4000.

10
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,480
And from my dropdown menu, I should be able to choose list files.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,860
And of course, that's the only one of the dropdowns here that works at the moment.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,220
And it should, in theory, only work for me.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,300
I o and if I click list, there's my whale tail.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,870
Taller?

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,410
Perfect.

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,570
Now we do have some other things here.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,400
For example, this delete does in fact pop a dialogue, but we can't delete anything yet.

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,230
We'll be adding that before too long.

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,440
But at the moment, I'm pretty sure that this works.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,140
So let's try one more thing.

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:24,650
I'll switch back to my finder and I'll open up the Mineo Test bucket and I'll put a second file in there.

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,690
These views don't zip should do the trick.

23
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,120
And I think come back here now and click list, it shows up.

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,080
Perfect.

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,800
OK.

26
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,380
Let's move on to uploading to the file system.
