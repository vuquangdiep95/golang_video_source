1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,040
So we have this bit listing the remote minnow Mineo file system working really well, and now we want

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,060
to work on this.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,180
The ability to upload files to the remote file system.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,290
And of course, that'll just give me a page not found error because we haven't written any of that code

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:15,510
yet.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,280
So let's get started.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:25,260
So back to our idea and I will start my application like stock and hide the terminal and let's get started.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,590
So what I'll do, first of all, is create a handler.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,740
So let me go over to handlers dot and go.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:39,010
Which is right here, and let's right the handler to display the upload page, and as you recall, we

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,960
already have the upload georgette file here in The View's folder, and that's what we want to point

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,230
to.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,370
So we'll create a function with a receiver of a pointer to handlers and we'll call it say, upload to

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:51,640
F.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,270
S for file systems and give it the standard two parameters for every handler, a response writer and

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,580
a pointer to in CTP to a request.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,160
And this is simple.

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,710
First of all, we are going to be getting a file system type query parameter.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:17,620
So let's trap for that first type is assigned error, the URL query not get.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,460
And if you look at the form on that upload jete file, the parameter is called type.

21
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:31,740
OK, and we'll create a variable because we need to pass some data to our our VAR map.

22
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,480
So we'll create a vase variable and that's of the type.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,740
Make a jetport VAR map just like before, and we'll add the file type to that first set.

24
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:48,130
And we'll call it if underscore type and the variable is EFS type.

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,220
So now we've set our data and now we just render that page.

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,910
Error is assigned the value of each dot render and we're going to render W an hour and we're going to

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,420
give the template upload because it's called upload.

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,400
Chet will hand it the variables we just created.

29
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,170
And as usual, I don't use that final parameter and we check for an error.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:17,440
If error is not equal to nil, then we'll render the error h to app error log print line and we'll just

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,220
print the error out.

32
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,330
And that's enough.

33
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,450
So we have this handler.

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,210
Let's go to our roots, file and add in that.

35
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,180
And we'll say, put it right here and yet.

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,380
And we're going to look for the path.

37
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,340
Let me go to my.

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,850
Layouts and find out what it's actually called.

39
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,800
So under layouts based on and yet what did I use for a URL there?

40
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:49,400
Upload a file is files, uploads or a copy that and switch back to roots.

41
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:56,650
And paste that in there and then pointed at that handler, a dog handlers dot upload to EFS.

42
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,310
Now if I start, my application may start.

43
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,070
I should be able to render that page.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,520
So it started.

45
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,940
Let's go back to our Web browser and just refresh this.

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,380
And there it is.

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,360
So as you can see, we have a dropdown menu and this is the only one we're going to use right now.

48
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,600
Mineo will browse for a file and we'll upload it.

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,540
So the next step is to create the handler to handle that form post, and we'll take care of that in

50
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,170
the next election.
