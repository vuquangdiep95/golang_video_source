1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,500
So the last thing we have to actually implement for our Web pages to be functional is that delete button

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,030
when you're looking at the listed file system from Mineo.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,620
There's a delete button next to it and I should actually have a handler and a route that makes that

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,120
functional, and that's pretty simple.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,570
So back in our file handlers dot and go in my app.

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,670
Let's go to the very bottom of this file and add a new handler, and we'll set the root up after the

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,060
fact.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,810
So func and this will be each pointer to handlers as usual, and we'll just call this one.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,730
Delete from FS for file systems with a response writer

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,260
and a pointer to a request.

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:52,840
And what I'll do is create a variable force, which is a type filesystems force that interface we defined

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,820
and then we'll go to.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,810
If you look at the actual list Fastjet over here and you go to the very bottom, we have some JavaScript

14
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,980
that actually deletes the item.

15
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,560
And what that does is fire up a little dialog box using that wonderful JavaScript library small.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,170
And it says, Do you want to delete this file?

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,790
Yes or no?

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:20,680
And if you click yes, then it calls the URL slash delete dash from dash fs and then it passes a query

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,280
parameter.

20
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,670
And that's the file system type and the name of the file to delete.

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,640
OK, so we're getting our file system type.

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,490
So back then our handlers, we better make sure we actually get that.

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:40,770
So that's type, which is a very well, I'm just declaring that's a sign of value from RW R Okwiri get

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,080
and I'm looking for the name EF-S lowercase underscore type.

25
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,570
OK, so now I know what filesystem type.

26
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,100
To delete that, we need to know what file to delete item is assigned the value of a URL on query.

27
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,010
Not yet.

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,400
And I'm looking for file and I would just switch on if it's tight.

29
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,210
Same as always.

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,169
Switch on FS type.

31
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:21,690
And the only case we care about right now is, meanwhile, case, you know, and we get our file system,

32
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:34,500
so f is assigned the value of each AP file systems at the key, meanwhile, has to file systems.

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,180
And now that variable f's, which were declared on one line 132 that is equal to can't just be equal

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,750
to f because one's a point or one's not.

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,970
So we pass a reference to F instead.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,710
Now we have our file system.

37
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,650
And of course, we'll add cases for all the other ones in a bit when we get to those file systems.

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,990
Now we will get the value deleted returned from.

39
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,060
And that's an assignment returned from the variable f's dot delete and that wants a slice of strings,

40
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,370
so we'll create a slice of string.

41
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,800
And inside of that, we'll just put item.

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,260
We're only deleting one thing and that will do the trick.

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,850
So delete it as a boolean if deleted, then.

44
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:33,610
H-2A app session put, and we use our context as always, and we're going to flash and we'll put format

45
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:43,820
Sprint F percent s was deleted and substitute item four percent, yes, OK.

46
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:55,190
And I will do a redirect HDP to redirect w her list fs same as before.

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:05,750
Question mark f s dash type equals plus f s type with the status http dot status c others.

48
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,540
And that should do it now.

49
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,100
Clearly, there's no error checking going in here because this isn't a production quality web page I'm

50
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,560
building.

51
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,339
This is just to demonstrate that a remote file systems work, and this is absolutely sufficient for

52
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,300
our purposes.

53
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,680
So let's switch over to rootstock, go and add a root into delete files.

54
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:32,180
And I'll just put it right here and you don't get and I want to get slash delete.

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:42,600
From that face, and that calls aid handlers from the office, and now when I restart my application,

56
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,940
make restart, this should all work.

57
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,480
So back we go over to our web browser, refresh this page to make sure it's current.

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,380
It is, and let's delete Whale Dash Big Dot Ping, so delete.

59
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,380
Am I sure I want to delete this file?

60
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,340
Yes, delete.

61
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,020
And we have an error.

62
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,460
So let's go back and see what we got wrong.

63
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,750
That happens sometimes.

64
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,980
And the air is.

65
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,370
Right up here.

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,460
Conversion interface is no, not minimal filesystems, I.

67
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,640
So I got something wrong, my handler must go to delete from file system, and if you misspell the key,

68
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,810
you're going to have a problem.

69
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm sure you saw that.

70
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,210
So let's make restart.

71
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,860
And back to my Web browser, and I'll go back one page.

72
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:49,320
To hear refresh this and now let's try deleting the whale big that looks better.

73
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,290
It's gone perfect.

74
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,920
So that takes care of testing out and making the core functionality active for minute, and we'll move

75
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,080
on to the next file system in the next section.
