1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,000
So far, we have the ability to put something to a remote file system, a mini file system and the ability

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,230
to list all of the contents of a given bucket on that.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,330
And we still need two more functions delete and get.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,460
So let's take care of delete this time around.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,660
So I'm still in the file mine ioco inside the mobile file system folder inside the file system folder

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,950
inside this Holyroodhouse folder and let's take care of delete and it's a pretty short function.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,270
Again, a func with the receiver of M Pointer to Mineo.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,950
And this one's called delete.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:43,590
And as you recall, that takes one parameter items to delete, which is a slice of string and it returns

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,170
of Boolean true or false.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,660
So once again, we need the context.

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:57,440
So CTCs and cancel come from context with cancel and we use context background as it's one parameter

13
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,930
and we defer cancel.

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,900
Now we need to get our client.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,780
So client is assigned the value of don't get credentials.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,820
And now we need to specify some options and I won't do them inline this time.

17
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,630
I'll do it this way.

18
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:23,570
Ops is a sign the value of Mineo Dot remove object options, and the only thing I want to put in there

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,140
is one parameter and it's one that if you're going to be working with Mineo or with S3 buckets, you

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,100
should read up on this.

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,560
It's called Governance Bypass, Governance Bypass, and I'm going to set that to true.

22
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,180
And there are situations, many situations actually where you want that.

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,710
You want to read about this a little bit and find out exactly what it does and make sure that you want

24
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,600
to set that to true.

25
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,580
But in our case, for our purposes today, this is perfect.

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,760
Now we'll just range through items to delete for I don't care about index, but I do care about the

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:04,040
current item is assigned the value of range items to delete, and all we do is check for an error and

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,450
call from our client.

29
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,550
Remove object, remove object right there.

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,660
And I don't know why I have parentheses around that, I must have been working in JavaScript recently.

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,670
So we'll get rid of those.

32
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,200
That's better.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,780
Now Remove Object takes a few parameters.

34
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,340
Context is the first one.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,250
The second one is what bucket are you dealing with?

36
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,380
Which is amp up bucket rate from the receiver.

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,060
What do you want to delete?

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,370
And that's item which we're getting through the range statement.

39
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,840
And finally, what are the options which we just specified right up above there?

40
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,440
OK.

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,370
So we try that and we try to check for an error if error is not equal to nil.

42
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,180
And I'll print it out.

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,570
Format dot print line the error and I'll return false because it failed.

44
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,160
OK, otherwise outside of this for loop, we just return true.

45
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,230
And that's all there is to it for deleting something from him in your file system.

46
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:01,710
OK.

47
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,060
So in the next lecture, we'll take care of the last function, which is get one.

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,740
You won't use very much, but just to be complete, we might as well implement it.

49
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,950
It's not a lot of work.
