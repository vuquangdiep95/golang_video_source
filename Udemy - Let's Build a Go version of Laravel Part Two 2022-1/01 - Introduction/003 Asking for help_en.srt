1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,770
So at some point during this course, you're probably going to want some help.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,780
You run into a problem you can't solve on your own and you need some assistance, and I'm happy to provide

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:09,990
that.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,260
But when you ask for help, there's a few steps you should take.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,150
Number one, search online and chances are you're going to do that by default, but just to be safe.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,770
Look online.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,110
If you've run into a problem, chances are somebody run into that before, and a quick search on Google

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,380
or your favorite search engine might give you the answer you're looking for.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,130
The second thing you can do that doesn't help is in every lecture, you'll be able to download the source

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,050
code for that lecture as it exists at the end of that lecture, so you can always compare your code

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,600
to mine, and that might provide some assistance as well.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,240
If that doesn't help, check the Q&A section, somebody might have already asked a question very similar

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,720
to yours, and the answer you're looking for might be found there.

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,090
Finally, feel free to ask a question of your own in the Q&A section, but if you do so, make sure

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,250
you give me some code to look at ideally.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,340
Give me a link to your git repository if you have one.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,650
If not, please be sure to include enough code so that I can look at what you're doing and try to provide

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,760
some useful assistance.

19
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,490
Otherwise, I'm just guessing, and that's not terribly helpful.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,870
All right, let's move on.
