1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,020
So I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about myself, but I suspect it's important to at least

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,910
give some kind of introduction.

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,450
I have been working in the software industry as an independent contractor for twenty five years.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,740
I'll show a little bit more now.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,490
And I've also been teaching at the university level since 1991, which means I do have a PhD.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,970
Actually, I have a Ph.D. in English literature and computer science and in education.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,170
But don't hold that against me.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,330
I teach at the university because I enjoy it, and it is certainly not my main source of income.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,300
I have won a bunch of awards regionally, nationally and internationally, including an Apple Award

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,930
at one point.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,720
And I've held contracts with KeyBanc, with General Motors, with Hewlett Packard, with Sprint and

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,130
many, many others across Canada, the United States and Europe.

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,920
And then I could talk about myself endlessly.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,990
But at the end of the day, I've been working in this field for a long time.

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,100
I've been teaching for a long time and I really enjoy teaching.

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,600
So let's get to it.
