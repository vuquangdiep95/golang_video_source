1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,059
So before we go too much further, let's make sure everything works.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,980
Now here and celebrities don't go.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,180
We have this function.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:13,060
Listen, APC, but at no point do we call it so we're not actually starting our listening on the PC

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,230
port and we can fix that.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,240
Let's go up to the function, listen and serve, which is right here.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,860
OK, so listen and serve.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,020
And down here at Line 286 in my code are simply type.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,340
Go see dot.

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,540
Listen, APC, OK, and that will start it in the background.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,900
Now open my terminal and Typekit make start, and I should see that message saying it's listening on

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,080
port one, two, three, four or five, and I do.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,750
So that's great.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,530
So in the next lecture, we'll get started on the middleware and make sure that when the package level

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:53,260
variable maintenance mode is true, that we give a an appropriate message to the user saying the is

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,530
currently in maintenance mode, and we'll get started on that in the next lecture.
