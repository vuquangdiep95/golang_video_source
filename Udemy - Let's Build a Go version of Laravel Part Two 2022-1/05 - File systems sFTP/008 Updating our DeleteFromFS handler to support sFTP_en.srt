1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,540
So the last step in this process with her SFB file system.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,950
Well, not quite the last step.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,170
We have a bit of cleanup to do, but we'll do that in a moment.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,410
The last major step is to permit deleting files from the remote as it SFB server.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,329
And of course, that's done here in handlers.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,310
Don't go in the Maya project in the handler named Delete from.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,250
And it probably comes as no surprise that what I'm going to do is copy this case in a switch statement.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,830
Paste it right here and change this to S&P.

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:40,980
Change the key to s f t p and cast everything to the appropriate data type, which is as FTB File System

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,060
S&P.

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,750
And with that one change, I should be able to say make stop.

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,590
Make start.

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,000
Wait for it to compile.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:59,520
Switch over to my Web browser list, my SFTP file system, and let's delete, say, SawStop Zip, I

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,090
click the delete button and delete and it's gone.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,800
And that's all there is to it.

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,550
OK, so S&P is mostly functional.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,490
Actually, it's entirely functional, but I do want to do a bit of cleanup in one bit of code, and

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,700
we'll take care of that last little bit of housekeeping in the next lecture.
