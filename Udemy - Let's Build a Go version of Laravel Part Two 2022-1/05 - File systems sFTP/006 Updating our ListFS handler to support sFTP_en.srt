1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:06,610
So now that we have our SFB file system connected to celebrities, the next step is to go to our handlers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,780
over in my app.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,040
So let's open up the file.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:16,520
My handlers don't go in the handlers folder in my app project and right here at the List F's file system.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,470
That's when I'll start with.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,360
It should be easy at this point.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,440
If you scroll down in this function called List EFS, we have this switch statement.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,890
We're switching on FS type.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,890
And right now we're only trapping for the case material.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,300
So I'll copy all of this, but not the closing curly bracket.

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,470
Or we'll have a syntax error and I'll paste it here and I'll just change it.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:47,650
I'll make this one SFTP and I'll make this as FPP and this as well as FTP.

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:54,550
And since we're grabbing the key of ESDP from this map file systems, we're not going to cast it to

14
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,730
mean I'll Filesystem will cast it to FTP file system FTP.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,520
And that should be all I have to do.

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,550
Except before we run this, it'll be useful to have a file in R.S.V.P. folder to make sure that things

17
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,110
work, so I'll go to my desktop.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,800
And I'll put this file, it doesn't matter what the file is, but I put it inside the folder SFTP,

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,510
which is, of course, in my app DV data SFTP.

20
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,890
And that should do the trick.

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,240
So let's go back here to our I.D. and start our application.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,410
Make start.

23
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,310
So it's running, so I switched my Web browser.

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:45,160
And I'll go to local host 4000 right there, and I'll go to filesystems and see if we got it right.

25
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,070
So let's make sure that Mineo still works.

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,870
It does.

27
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,570
Now let's look at SFTP.

28
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,900
And there it is, their source dog zip now delete doesn't work and uploading doesn't work.

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,300
But at this point, that's trivial.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,920
We're basically using the same logic.

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,780
We're adding something to our switch statements.

32
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,740
So we'll get started on uploading a file in the next lecture.
