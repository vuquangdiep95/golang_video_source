1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,600
So we're getting closer, and the next step is to handle uploading something to our remote FTP server

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,220
so that can handlers start go?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,170
Let's go down and find the post upload to Efes right here.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,340
And basically the same logic as we applied last time around applies this time.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,250
I'm going to copy this case for minute

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,760
and paste it right here and change this to S.F..

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:38,200
And again, I'm going to look at my application file systems field for the key SFTP and cast that to

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,670
an SFO file system.

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,710
SFTP.

10
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,330
And literally that should take care of it.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,830
There's no other change necessary to make, and this is largely because we took all that time to make

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,820
sure that our file systems all conform to the same interface.

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,570
All right.

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,540
So let's stop her application.

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,620
Make stop.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,570
Make start.

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,670
And see if this works actor or web browser, and right now, I have one thing on my SFB file system

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,510
SawStop Zip.

19
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,360
So let's try uploading something to that.

20
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,490
So we'll choose SFP and I'll find some file doesn't matter what it is.

21
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,070
I'll choose this way of image again, and I'll try uploading that and see how this works out.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,030
And it says it's uploaded, let's go see if we can find it.

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:45,650
File systems, list files and I'm going to choose S&P and the whale should be there.

24
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,370
And there it is.

25
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,630
And that works really well.

26
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,420
Now one more thing to look at here.

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:57,320
If we go back to our I.D. and look at the console, you can see that little statement, I said to print

28
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,520
the current working directory.

29
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,820
It says current working directory is slash.

30
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,990
And of course, if I want to upload to another place on that file system, say a folder underneath the

31
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,450
root level, of course, that's where this bit.

32
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:21,590
And we'll find it here over insularity, us under filesystems, under SFTP.

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,350
We find the part that puts it up there.

34
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,460
Which is right here.

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,790
This is where we need to make a slight modification to our code.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,960
We don't always want to upload to the root level of our file system.

37
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:46,760
Instead, we should probably modify this code right here where it says client create path based file

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,090
name.

39
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,890
We should change that, maybe to an s print f so format print f with a format string.

40
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,220
And that would be percent s slash percent s.

41
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,100
And then in here, we can take this first parameter or take this parameter out, cut it.

42
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:16,430
And our substitutions in now would be folder that parameter that we received up in the signature for

43
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,240
this function.

44
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:23,600
And now we can put the based file name in there, and that will allow us to upload to a specific location

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,710
on the remote file system.

46
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,180
So that was just a simple change.

47
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,660
OK.

48
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,040
All right.

49
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,370
Next, we'll take care of deleting something from our SFTP server.
