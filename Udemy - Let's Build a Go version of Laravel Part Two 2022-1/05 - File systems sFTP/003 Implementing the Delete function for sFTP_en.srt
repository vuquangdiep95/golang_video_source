1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,140
So we only have two more functions to complete in the S&P Go file in order for this to satisfy and be

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,850
functional, to satisfy the file systems interface.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,730
Those are delete and get in this time around will take care of delete.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,360
And the first thing I'll do is say some typing by coming up here and copying the client bit from list

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,510
where I get my client right up to and including defer client close and we'll come down here and put

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,650
it in the delete function.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:37,230
We'll have to fix the return type and we return a false instead of what we were doing with a list function.

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:37,710
So.

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,770
Now, after we defer client clothes, it becomes dead simple.

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:49,400
All we're doing here is we're getting a slice of strings which have the full path name to all the files

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,080
we want to delete on the remote server.

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,850
So we'll just range through it for we don't care about the index, we do care about the current item,

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,990
which I'll call X again.

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,380
Those are populated by ranging through items to delete, and it's simple.

15
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:10,880
We get checked for an error delete error, which I'll call it, that is assigned the value from calling

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,080
Client SD as client got removed.

17
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,200
And that's what delete something and we're going to delete X if there is an error.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,500
If delete error is not equal to nil, then as you say, return false.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
OK, something went wrong.

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,530
And I have read dear when it should say, remove how I did that.

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,290
There we go.

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,040
That makes more sense.

23
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,060
And that is literally it.

24
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,520
Now, of course, I'm returning a boolean.

25
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,460
You may want to return an error instead.

26
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,740
That's entirely up to you, but a simple that's a simple enough change to make.

27
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:54,160
Of course, you'd have to change the signature for all of the required methods in file system start

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,880
ifs.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,430
So the delete returns in error instead of a Boolean.

30
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,310
But I'm OK with the Boolean, so I'll leave it like that.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,300
So that was delete that was dead simple.

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,420
And in the next lecture, we'll take care of get and then we'll try things out.
