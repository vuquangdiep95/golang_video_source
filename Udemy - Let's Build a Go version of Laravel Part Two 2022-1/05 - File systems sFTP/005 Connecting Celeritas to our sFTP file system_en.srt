1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,520
So we have all of the necessary functions implemented in our executive go file, and now we're ready

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,850
to start trying things out with celebrities.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,090
Now, to be clear, there are some things we're going to want to clean up, particularly this get function,

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,380
but we'll get to those shortly.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,600
Don't worry about that right now.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,350
Let's just see if we can get it working.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,980
And of course, the first thing I have to do is to go to celebrities.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,750
The celebrities project and open up celebrities don't go and find that bit.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,380
Where I create the file systems in my code, it's right here in the file.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:36,050
Celebrities don't go around line three hundred and eighty three, and the only one we have right now

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,800
is midnight.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,400
So of course, we also want to add one for SFTP, and we can use the same logic to see whether or not

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,200
we should try to create that file system and add it to the map for celebrities.

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:55,760
We can say if OST don't get on and we're going to look for something I know that is in my own file and

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,550
that's s f t p underscore host.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,450
If that exists, and it does exist, probably.

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,430
But if it's not equal to an empty string, which is what it will be if there's no value set there or

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,500
if it can't find that key in the data on file, if it's not equal to an empty string, then I want to

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,190
try to set it up.

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:21,500
So I'll create a variable called SFTP, which makes sense and will make that equal to S.F. file systems,

21
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,570
which it should find for me, SFTP and I did, and we'll just populate its fields.

22
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,370
And it needs a host, and we get that from the OS oes don't get on.

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:38,930
And that is SFTP host said TP underscore host as a t p there is.

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,910
And we need the user and that's.

25
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,980
Don't get on TPY user right there.

26
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,520
We want the password.

27
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,890
So pass.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,970
And that's O.S., don't get on SFTP Pass.

29
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,540
And the last thing, of course, is the port.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,310
Port, and that's equal to OS, don't get on SFTP port.

31
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,470
OK, so now we've created that variable.

32
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,570
We just added to the map.

33
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:24,850
So we'll add to our map file systems at the key SFP, which seems logical.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,190
We'll make that equal to SFTP.

35
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,180
And that should be all we have to do to create their connect celebrities to that particular file system.

36
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,080
Of course, we still have to use it and we'll get started on that in the next lecture.
