<h4><strong>Important: Code Changes</strong></h4><p>Some MongoDB methods (just a few) I'm using in the next videos have been deprecated.</p><p>The changes are minor and summarized here: <a href="https://github.com/simplesteph/grpc-go-course/pull/1/files " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/simplesteph/grpc-go-course/pull/1/files </a></p><p>If you download the code from <a href="https://github.com/simplesteph/grpc-go-course" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/simplesteph/grpc-go-course</a> you will have the latest and working code</p><blockquote><p>Overall, this doesn't change any understanding for this section, but should avoid a little bit of frustration :) Happy learning!</p></blockquote>
