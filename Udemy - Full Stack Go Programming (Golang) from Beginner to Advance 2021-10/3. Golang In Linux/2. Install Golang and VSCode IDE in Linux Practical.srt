1
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,480
Hello and welcome to the Guoliang programming language course in this session, we want to talk about

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,570
install the go programming language practically inside the Linux operating system.

3
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,480
First in a stall, the Golan.

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,920
Go land dot org, slash the URL.

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,580
We entered the gold and software download page based on the desired operating system, selecting installation

6
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,200
file and download it because my system is leaning.

7
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,840
We select the Linux installation fine.

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,430
And go to Lenovo's tap.

9
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,780
And copy the name of the last version of Golang.

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,550
Now open a new terminal and downloaded by Debbie Lou, get command.

11
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:47,100
So be right, w get Dash C, H T T P s column s S-Class go lang dot org slash dl slash and paste the

12
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,610
name of the last version of Go Blank that we have copied it.

13
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,790
Now, download this starting.

14
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:13,990
The download completed in this time, check the integrity of the tar ball by verifying the SHA 256 checksum

15
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,930
of the archive file using the source and comment saw the right solution.

16
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:30,910
Dash, a 256 and paste name of the Go Lang last version that we have copied it.

17
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:44,800
Now we can get the SHA 256 checksum hashes of the fine and it's quiet now extracted are confined into

18
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,640
this user.

19
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,380
It's local directory.

20
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,970
So in terminal, go to destination of the archive file, download it and extract go lang.

21
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,590
File into Escort's use it.

22
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:04,750
If this local by this command sudo tar the ash see.

23
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,260
Escorts, user escorts, local.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,250
That's exquisite Earth.

25
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,780
Name of the last version of Golden Boy, the title Dodd.

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,400
Geez, it.

27
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,960
For the check, we will go to the S-Class User Escorts Local Directory.

28
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,190
And now we see the gold and installed chronic.

29
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:45,030
Now configuring Golang environment in Linux, first set up your Go workspace by creating a directory

30
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:53,280
at home for the example named Go Online Projects, which is the root of your workspace, the workspace

31
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,210
is made of three directories, namely Bing, which will contain go executable binaries.

32
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,890
SRT will be restore your source files and pcgg, which will restore package objects.

33
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,480
Now let's go to write some commands for create workspace.

34
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,190
Sudo.

35
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:33,530
In the air DSP home S.A. go on the line, projects open, Credible says Bien como SIRC como pcgg and

36
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,030
close curly braces.

37
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,530
Now go to home and check the go on the line project, walk to space.

38
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:50,610
All the directory is created and see all things is okay now it's time to execute, go.

39
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,250
Like the rest of Linux programs without specifying its absolute path.

40
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,520
Its installation directory must be installed as one of the values of path environment variable.

41
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,270
So at its user, it's not local.

42
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,600
It's let's go if there's been to the path environment variable by inserting in your search ETSI as that's

43
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:21,270
profile file for a system wide installation or home Slashdot profile or home Slashdot bash on the line

44
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,390
profiling for user specific installation.

45
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:33,270
Now we set it for user a specific installation so open the user profile means that Slashdot profile

46
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,010
and add this line.

47
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:52,400
Export pact equals pact, Colin Less user, it's less local.

48
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,440
Let's let's go.

49
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:05,590
Slash bean then set the values of girl pat and go bingo environment variables in your user profile fine

50
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,390
to point your workspace directory.

51
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,420
So add these lines in profile.

52
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,470
Export, go, pat.

53
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,510
Equals.

54
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,510
Whole east, let's go on the line projects.

55
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,280
Export.

56
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,920
Go being.

57
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,360
Equals.

58
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:33,750
Girl power.

59
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,650
It's last been.

60
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,290
The final list that honors this section is to effect the changes made to the user profile in the current

61
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,210
position by source comment.

62
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,840
So we right source.

63
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,350
Home air slash.

64
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:12,140
Dot profile and execute this comment for verifying go link installation, run the go version and go

65
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,410
and in to view your gold version and environment.

66
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,130
So be right, go.

67
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,020
Well done.

68
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:27,170
Now we can see the gold version and go, and now we can see the environment of go.

69
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,640
So the installation is correctly and everything.

70
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,520
All right.

71
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,690
Now it's time to install Visual Studio code on Debian, or up until the most preferred method of in

72
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:46,730
a stunning visual studio code on Debian based systems is by enabling the VIOUS Code repository and installing

73
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,600
the Visual Studio Code package using the APT package manager.

74
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,650
So first, we try sudo apt.

75
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,310
Update.

76
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,340
The update is a starting and wait until update complete.

77
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:18,290
OK, the update has got completed once updated Prosit in install dependencies required by executing.

78
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,630
So we write.

79
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,240
Sudo apt in a song.

80
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:35,290
Software, the ICE properties that's common is space apt.

81
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:44,070
Dash Transport Dash has two tips and execute the program is being installed.

82
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,350
Press Y and continue.

83
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,050
Wait, Anthony, installation complete.

84
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:08,130
OK, installation complete next, using the W, you get comment, download the repository and import

85
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,910
Microsoft's GPG keys for convenience.

86
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,550
I have already saved them in the fine copy and put them in the terminal.

87
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,990
So go to our fine.

88
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:31,680
Well, Penny, copy these lines and move them to the terminal and execute them one by one.

89
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:05,490
Once you have enabled the repository, update the system and installed visual studio code by running

90
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,180
the command.

91
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,080
So do.

92
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,350
Opted.

93
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,610
The update is starting.

94
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,710
Wait until update complete.

95
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,080
And sudo apt get install.

96
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,280
Could.

97
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,240
Due to its size, the installation takes approximately five minutes.

98
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:41,690
Once in its thought, used application manager to search visual studio code and launch it.

99
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,090
OK.

100
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,850
This software installation process is complete.

101
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,970
Now it's time to go to configure device code.

102
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,890
So open the Vasco.

103
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:12,260
First opened Extension's marketplace by council plus shift plus short key and search go extension and

104
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,370
install it.

105
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,330
OK.

106
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,550
It's installed.

107
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:33,630
And now open common pilot by console plus shift plus Pete Shawki and select Go column in a stone slash

108
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,620
update tools.

109
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,320
And select all the check boxes for in a stunning all requires tools.

110
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,530
Now we are waiting for the installation of the required tools to be completed.

111
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,000
OK.

112
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:05,050
Download complete it now for Test, create a simple project, so go to Explorer Project and go to work

113
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,620
a space.

114
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,350
And create a folder like, hello.

115
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,680
And inside it, create a fight.

116
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,610
Like Maine that go.

117
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,350
And write some quotes.

118
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,140
In future, we will talk about these quotes here, just we want to tests.

119
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,630
All right, package main.

120
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:48,710
Forage Maine and write the message by the comment FMD, not print and set the message, for example.

121
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,420
Welcome to go programming.

122
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,020
Language.

123
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,710
Save the project, go to terminal and run the project first.

124
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,200
Go to hell of a lower.

125
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,430
Hello.

126
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,370
And run the project by the comment Go Run.

127
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,600
Plane that go.

128
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:23,510
Now we can see the message Welcome to go, programming language, all things are OK and you're ready

129
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,710
to write your codes.

130
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,080
OK, we have reached the end of decision.

131
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,230
I hope that you have take full advantage of decision until next session.

132
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:31,850
Goodbye.
