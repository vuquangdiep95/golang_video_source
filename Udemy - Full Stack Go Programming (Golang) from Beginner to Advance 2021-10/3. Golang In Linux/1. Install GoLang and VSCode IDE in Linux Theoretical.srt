1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,490
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:27,370
installing, go learning and preparing this code idea in Windows operating system and indecision.

3
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,610
You want to talk about the installing Go Lang and repainting this good idea in Linux operating system.

4
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,060
How to install Golang in Linux system.

5
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:51,500
First, go to go blank dot org slash deal and download the latest version of Google Lang in an archive,

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,620
find using Debian you get comment as follows.

7
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,260
Now select Go Lang version based by operating system.

8
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,730
If our OS is 64 bit select Go Lang 64 bit version.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,610
And if it is 32 bit, we select Go Lang version 32 bit.

10
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:27,370
Next, check the integrity of the tarpon by verifying the SHA 256 checks, some of the are qualified

11
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:36,550
using the South comment as below where the flag dash is used to specify the algorithm to be used.

12
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:49,030
Samson Dash, a 256 Go Lang Dart part Dart Cheez-It To show that the contents of the downloaded are

13
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,440
confie are the exact copy provided on the Go Lang website.

14
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:02,500
The 256 bit hash value generated from the comment about as seen in the output should be the same as

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,650
the provided lounge with the download link.

16
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,100
If that is the case, proceed to the next step.

17
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,820
Otherwise download the new tar ball and run the check again.

18
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:24,170
Then extract the tar archive, find into RSS, use the restless local directory using the comment below.

19
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:38,780
Sudo tar dash c uppercase SS user SS Local Dash IX visit f go lang dot tar dot gz where Dash C upper

20
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,690
is specifies the destination directory.

21
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,510
First set up your go watch space by creating a directory home, go on their projects, which is the

22
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,340
root of your workspace space.

23
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:04,220
The focus phase is made of three directors, namely being which will contain go executable binaries

24
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:12,080
S4C, which will store your source vine and pcgg, which will store package objects.

25
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:22,790
Therefore, create about directories as follows and call the Air Dash P home slash go on the project.

26
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:33,350
Slash open and close calibrations and between input been comma s or C and comma pcgg m code.

27
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,280
The air means make directory and second c.

28
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:46,550
The whole S lets go on their projects, see the means change directory and to else means least files

29
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,990
and directories.

30
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:59,840
Now it's time to execute, go like the rest of Linux programs without specifying its absolute patterns,

31
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,310
its installation directory must be installed as one of the Valley of Pad Environment variables.

32
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:17,210
Now at such user, it's local as Let's Go West has been to the path environment variable by inserting

33
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:26,510
the line below in your research ethics fine, fine for a system wide installation or home Slashdot profile

34
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,970
or home Slashdot bash online profile two user a specific installation.

35
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,760
Using your preferred ED weapon, the appropriated user profile fired as per your distribution and at

36
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,900
the line below.

37
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,630
So save the file and exit it.

38
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,560
Export pact equals pact columnists use it as such, local estimates go as this been.

39
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:02,840
And then set the values of go pat and go bingo environment variables in your user profile find to point

40
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,100
to your space directory.

41
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:15,310
Export go pack equals home IST, let's go on the line projects and export go being equals.

42
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,680
Go pack it slash beam.

43
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,350
If you install Golang in a custom directory other than the default path means it's less user, it's

44
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,990
less local.

45
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,570
You must specify that directory as the venue of the Go Route variable.

46
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,540
For example, if you have installed Go Lang in the home directory at the lines below to your home Slashdot

47
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:53,770
profile or home, a Slashdot bash underline profile file export go root equals home slash, go and export.

48
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,100
Pack equals pack column.

49
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,720
Go to the slash mean.

50
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:07,580
The final step on the decision is to effect the changes made to the user profile in the current PrÃ©cision,

51
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:20,360
so right souls home don't bash online profile and execute or source home if Slashdot profile.

52
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:33,420
Very fine go blank installation around the comments below to view your go version and environment,

53
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,800
go version to see the version of Go Lag and Go Ms.

54
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,270
To see the go your environment.

55
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:54,630
Type the following command to display use age information for the GO tool, which many schools source

56
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,120
code go help.

57
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,580
To test if your go installation is water chaotically, right, is small, go.

58
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:15,350
Hanawalt program save the fine in-home go on the line project saucier slash hello directory on your

59
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:24,110
go lang source files must be and with the Don't Go extension, begin by creating the Hello Project directory

60
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,860
on their home.

61
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:35,960
Go on the line project as Slash CRC, so we right in the air dash p home go on the line projects r sirc

62
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:45,500
slash hello, then use your favorite editor to create the Hello Dot Go find in the Halo Directory in

63
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:57,380
this example we used from VM, so write the I Home must go on the line projects s less SIRC as such.

64
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,600
Hello s nash.

65
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,020
Hello dot goo.

66
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,920
Now go to create a sample.

67
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,130
Add the lines below in the fine, save it and exit it.

68
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:21,650
Now compiling the program evolve as using go in, install and run, it's so full compiled, we use go

69
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,410
in a town, come in and run the program we use Go Run.

70
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:37,040
If you see the message, hello, welcome to the Golang programming in Linux, so your installation is

71
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,440
working correctly.

72
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,720
Install visual studio code on Debian and open to.

73
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:53,750
The most preferred method of installing visual studio code on Debian based systems is by enabling the

74
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:00,800
voice code repository and installing the Visual Studio could package using the app package manager.

75
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,240
So we use the command, so the app update.

76
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:18,610
Once updated, proceed in install dependency required by executing the command sudo apt install software,

77
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,640
Dash Properties, Dash Common APT Dash Transport, Dash STPs.

78
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,930
Next, using the devil you get command.

79
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,300
Download the repository and import Microsoft's GPG key as shown.

80
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:47,120
Once you have enabled the repository, update the system and installed visual studio code by running

81
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,500
the comment, so do APT Update and sudo APT install code.

82
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,170
Due to its size, the installation takes approximately five minutes.

83
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:07,460
Once installed, use the application manager to search Visual Studio code and launch it as shown.

84
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,320
Install vs code extensions after the installation launch vehicle.

85
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:28,230
Then opened a St. John's marketplace by the council plus shift plus x chalky and search go and install

86
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,650
it.

87
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,600
Now it's time to install up the tools for do this.

88
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:44,460
Open the comment palette by the Control Plus Sheathed Plus piece key and around the Go column install

89
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,550
update tools common after ex-security.

90
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,190
You can see go extensions listed here, selling all and install them.

91
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,630
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue to contend in

92
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,500
the next session.

93
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,280
Goodbye.
