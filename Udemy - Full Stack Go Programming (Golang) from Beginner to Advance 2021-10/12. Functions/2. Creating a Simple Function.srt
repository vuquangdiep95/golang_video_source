00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,080
Hello and welcome to the golden and programming language course in the previous session, we talked

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,470
about function declaration, and in this session we want to talk about the other function concept

3
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,480
creating a simple function.

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,880
A declaration function begins with the keyboard, followed by the name you want to function to have

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,620
a paid off prances and then a ballot containing your functions code.

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,870
Simple function takes no parameter and returns no values.

7
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,410
Now go to this code and illustrate how to create a simple function.

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:07,690
First, create a project folder for the example, named Park Share and create a file.

9
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,490
I mean, the article read Package

10
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:25,390
Package me first create the simple function that has nuts, parameters and returned values for the example

11
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:33,070
form set a name like super function.

12
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,240
It paid off parenthesis and curly brackets.

13
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:49,650
Now we can define a simple function without any parameters, and the returned values here are just print

14
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,580
ahead of word as per a statement.

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,330
The he.

16
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:55,820
Hello.

17
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,990
What saved the project?

18
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,290
It's time to confirm your function.

19
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:11,690
One, creating function, you give a definition of what the function has to do to use a function, you

20
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,020
will have to call the function to perform the defined task.

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,470
When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the call function.

22
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:29,210
It can't function, performs a defined task and then its return a statement is executed or when its

23
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,080
function and in closing braces reached its returns.

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,900
The program comes back to the main program.

25
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:45,020
Now, create the main function and invoke define function inside a fine name

26
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,360
and now invoke this simple function simple function.

27
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,510
Reform of the code.

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,440
Save the project and execute the program.

29
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:04,630
First, go to the function package, see the function and run the program.

30
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,750
Go the bank is the main tool.

31
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,590
Now we can see the output.

32
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:19,970
We could define the function name simple function that has no parameters and no return values.

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:28,970
And can this function inside man function and execute in a c, the value of a statement that is hello

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,420
in order not to prolong the time of decision.

35
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,530
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

36
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,400
Goodbye.
