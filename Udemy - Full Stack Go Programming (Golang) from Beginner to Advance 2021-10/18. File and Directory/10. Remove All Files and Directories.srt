00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,920
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,700
In the previous session, we talked about how to delete or remove the file and the folder go language.

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,370
And in this session, we want to talk about the other files and directories concept.

4
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:39,580
Remove all directories and files and go land in gold language, you are allowed to remove all the directory

5
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:45,310
that finds from a directory or folder with the help of remove all function.

6
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,970
This function removes all the directories and files from the path you will pass to this function.

7
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:59,110
It will remove everything from the specified path, but returns the first error it encounters.

8
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,090
If the specified path does not exist, then this method returns nil.

9
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,630
If this function throws an error, then it will be off time parser.

10
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,410
Now you can see the syntax.

11
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,460
It is defined under the OS package, so you have to import Always Package in your program for accessing

12
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,750
remove all function.

13
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:27,550
Let's go to this school program to illustrate how to remove all folders and files from the default directory.

14
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,320
First, we create a folder named Sample.

15
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:44,640
And Create who finds inside it named Test one test and test to that the.

16
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,600
Test one that takes the.

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,980
And test tube got.

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,420
And they create a folder named 10 one in sample directory.

19
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,560
Sample learning to through a folder and.

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,660
And then inside tent one, create another finds like Test 3.6, dentist 4.60.

21
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,100
Tist 3.60.

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,010
And in turn, will create another fine test for the.

23
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,810
OK.

24
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,530
The files and folders are created.

25
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,620
Now let's go to main function to remove the created all files and folders.

26
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,980
Remove all function, get the car and pass as argument and remove the files and folders.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,050
If there is an error, it will be a time pass.

28
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,660
So first, define a variable like you are calling equals and can't remove all functions from oils.

29
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,380
Package or start streaming.

30
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,520
On Fawcett, the current pass, right click on the folder created named in the Explorer and select reveal

31
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,420
in the File Explorer and copy the current pass from address, bar and poutine here and append the folder

32
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,890
name end of this pass.

33
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,560
So right click.

34
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,480
Revenue in File Explorer and kupuna

35
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,200
and set as argument for gaming

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,640
sit dormant backslash, though, either make a splash.

37
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,870
Over breakfast, lunch and over breakfast, lunch and silver make a splash.

38
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,300
OK.

39
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,520
The project name is finds directories,

40
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,880
fonts, dash directories,

41
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,080
backslash, backslash and Santa folder.

42
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,420
OK, now we check the printed message if the error is not empty.

43
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,790
If you are not equal to me.

44
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,000
So print a message.

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,280
Large print and.

46
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,740
And said the error message.

47
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:42,240
OK, now go to the dash directories, pass and see files and folders, so we use on the air, come in

48
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:53,100
and see sample folder, go to the sample, see the sample and again during our week Test 1.60 test to

49
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,700
the test and 10 one folder, go to the tampon folder.

50
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,730
See 10 one folder.

51
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:07,410
And again, we are and we can see Test 3.6 and test for the next week.

52
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,770
We go to the car and pass.

53
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:22,770
We gave see the CD, its science and save the project and execute the program by the car and go wrong

54
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,350
the main that could.

55
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,830
Now we can see the output.

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,640
First, we created files and folders inside each other in content past and then using the removal function

57
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,070
from the OS package, and we were able to delete all the created files and folders.

58
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:50,140
Again, we go to find that directories passed by the comma in the air and we see it on files and folders

59
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,810
and deleted from here in order not to prolong the time of decision.

60
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,700
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

61
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,620
Goodbye.
