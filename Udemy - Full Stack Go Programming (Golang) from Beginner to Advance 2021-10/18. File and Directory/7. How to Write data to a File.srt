00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,810
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,990
Independent musician, we talked about how to redefine and indecision.

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,070
We want to talk about the other files and directories concept.

4
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,830
How to ride.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,630
Define.

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,810
Go Lang offers a vast, in-built library that can be used to perform, read and write operations.

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:50,440
Enfance will be right the string in the fine using old start writing string function writers, doing

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,570
functions, write the contents of this string and it returns the number of bytes written and it all

9
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,150
is in.

10
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,270
Now you can see the syntax.

11
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,890
Let's go to the school program to write, define,

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,320
first, create the font and name it to start text by the create function.

13
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,030
This function takes the foreign name as an argument and creates it.

14
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,320
The return value of this function is defined and and the rules in case an error is thrown, it received

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,490
by the IRR variable, and that's all a function of luck.

16
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:40,510
So first, define two variable like fine and you are calling equals in the create function from always

17
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:53,230
the package and set a fine then like test the tasty prints, the error message and stops program execution.

18
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:08,890
If we are not equals to need, so call fatal function from like package but a function and sets a message

19
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:23,680
like failed to create a fine person s and set our message.

20
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,470
The author is used for purpose of clean up like closing running fine after the fine has been written

21
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,710
and main function has completed execution.

22
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,910
So right, write the author finds that close.

23
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,120
Now read the text and defined by Connie write a string function.

24
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,910
This function will return to values for the example in variable chapters.

25
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,330
The length of this and written to define and error variable.

26
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:10,170
So define two variable like Len and E are calling equals call write issing function from Phi Phi Dart,

27
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,960
write a string function and set a value like hello.

28
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,830
And then from.

29
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,190
To practice medicine,

30
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,550
go.

31
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,530
Programming

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,240
language.

33
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,600
Prince, the error message and the staff's program execution is a road not equals need.

34
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:57,990
So go to what is statement of if and right message from on Earth of light package Lord God, Father

35
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:14,290
Earth and sit in the sage failed writing to find cursed is and said a raw message.

36
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:27,240
Now we use name function that returns the name of define as presented, created middle and display length

37
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:39,900
of the file by following codes for the example that if backslash and forehead name calling persons is.

38
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:53,040
And since he finds that name function and go to the next line if batches and lengths

39
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:02,250
persons, the bonds assets lend value.

40
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,850
OK, reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

41
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:21,630
Now we can see the output first, fine test, the text we created and we can see fine main test, the

42
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:29,550
text and length is four or five bytes, so we were able to say the setup is strings inside the file

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,730
in order not to prolong the time of decision.

44
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,750
We'll finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

45
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,560
Goodbye.
