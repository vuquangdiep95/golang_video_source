00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,970
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,490
rename, file or folder and go Lanc.

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,250
And in this session, we want to talk about the other files and directories concept.

4
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,360
Check either a file or directory exists.

5
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:43,720
It's that function and is not exist, function can be used to check whether a particular file or directory

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,560
exists or not as the function returns a finding for describing the named fine.

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,580
If there is an error, it will be off time pass.

8
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,820
Or now you can see the syntax.

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,750
Is not exist, function returns a Boolean, indicating whether the error is known to report that the

10
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,970
file or directory does not exist.

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,780
Now you can see the syntax of is not exist.

12
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:19,920
Now let's go to this school program to illustrate how to check if a file or directory exists.

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,620
First, we use the ISTAT function, which returns defined info is structured, describing fine if this

14
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,390
function returns an error.

15
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:37,650
We use the E's not exist to determine if the error is caused by the fact that the directory already

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,160
exists.

17
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:50,790
So first defined to vary event like find info and enrolled calling equals invalid stat function from

18
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,780
all this package.

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,110
O.

20
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,600
S Dot stats

21
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,430
and set file name for the example 10.

22
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,160
Now, right, that is not exist.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,860
Function is not text function returns a Boolean, indicating whether the error is known to report that

24
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,410
the file or directory does not exist.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:31,440
So if Invoke is not expulsion from all aspects, OS dog is not exist and set a all go to the bot, his

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,980
statement.

27
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,880
In this case, if is not exist, function return a true value, write a statement based on the fact

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,410
that the file does not exist.

29
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:51,180
So from the large package that photog and set a message like backslash, a file

30
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,100
does not exist

31
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,430
now.

32
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:07,920
Display defined in variable that describes the file structure by print and function from like package

33
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:18,960
la dah print and set fire info as arguement saved the project and execute the program.

34
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:32,120
Now we can see the output, the these is fine is not available, so the program enters the eve block

35
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,980
and an arrow related to absence of the fine is displayed.

36
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,540
We are already doing these to check if a folder exists or not.

37
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:59,130
So change the fine name to a folder and change the message folder and see it is valid for all the info

38
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:08,100
and change your folder info reformat format the code save the project and again execute the program.

39
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:18,900
Now we can see down that these are folder does not exist and the program into the if block and an error

40
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,660
related to the absent of the folder is display.

41
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:29,790
So we were able to check the existence or not existence of a file or folder using the ISTAT and is not

42
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,170
exist functions in order not to prolong the time of decision.

43
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,460
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

44
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,300
Goodbye.
