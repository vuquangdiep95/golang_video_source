00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,860
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,210
how to read and write a following and go line and indecision.

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,230
We want to talk about the other fines and directories concept.

4
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,670
How to delete or remove the file and the folder and go blank in the go language, you're allowed to

5
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,890
remove the existing file and folder with the help of the remove function.

6
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:52,590
This method removes the specified font from the director, or it also removes empty directories.

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,910
If the given pass is incorrect, then it will through and the roar of time pass through, it is defined

8
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,270
under the Otis package.

9
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,050
So you have to import or is packaging your program for accessing premium function.

10
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,930
Now you can see the syntax.

11
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,910
Let's go to this school program to illustrate how to remove, file and folder from the default directory.

12
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:31,700
First, firstly, create the file named test that takes the encoded directory, test the T60 and create

13
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,550
a folder named tent in common directory.

14
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,400
OK.

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,050
The file and folder are created now, go to main function to remove the created file and folder.

16
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,890
First, removing file from the current directory using renal function of oboist package.

17
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,360
Remove function.

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,410
Get defined name as arguement and remove the name fine.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,700
If there is an error, it will be off time past or so.

20
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:13,040
First, define a variable like find a roll call and equals invoke remove function from OS package.

21
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:22,770
Go to remove and said Test the this argument test T60.

22
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:33,240
Now we take the printed message if the error is not, and so is file or not equal to need.

23
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,960
So the message log got cleaned and set fire at all.

24
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:53,310
OK, now removing folder from the current directory using remove function of OS package.

25
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:02,120
So define another variable like folder or call an equals and remove function from this package.

26
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,060
And said folder name 10.

27
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:17,880
Now we check to print a message if the arrow is not empty folder or not equal mean.

28
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,660
So set the error message call in from like high case

29
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,440
and set folder or reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

30
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,270
Now we can see the output first, we created the fund named Test to expand the folder name tent in the

31
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,950
current pass and then using the remote function from the office package, and we were able to delete

32
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,710
the created finance folder.

33
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,730
Now we can go to the current directory and see the finance folders by the comment.

34
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,180
The IRR.

35
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,690
Now we can see by name, the text and folder team does not exist here.

36
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,880
In order not to pronounce the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content

37
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,960
in the next session.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,490
Goodbye.
