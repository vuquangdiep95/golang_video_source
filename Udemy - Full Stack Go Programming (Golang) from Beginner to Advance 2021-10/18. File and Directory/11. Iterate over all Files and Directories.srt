00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,020
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the perilous.

2
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,500
We talked about of all phones and directories in Golden.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,020
And in this section, we want to talk about the other files and directories concept.

4
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:40,690
Iterate over on phones and folders for a pass like function offering the pass package can be used to

5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,370
recursively iterate over on phones and folder in the directory tree.

6
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:54,270
What function gets the rules passed as argument and will walk the entire two route it at the rules passed

7
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,010
include all subdirectories and gets the watch funk as argument and will be called for.

8
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,240
Read the parts of the file folder and find info or the it or if any animal occured while walking that

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,200
fine folder.

10
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,590
Now you can see this scene takes some things to note about what function.

11
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,050
All errors are filtered and errors might arise while opening.

12
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:30,240
Define the function does not follow symbolic links, and the finds are locked in the Lexicon order.

13
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:37,770
Now, let's go to the school program to illustrate how to iterate over all files and folders for a pass.

14
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,480
First, we create a folder named sampler.

15
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:53,860
And create to find inside it named Test one and test to.

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,150
Test one that takes the.

17
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:12,920
And test to get to 60 and then create a folder named Tent Von in sample directory.

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,820
Ten point.

19
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:27,030
And then inside tampon, create another file like this three, the dentist 4.60.

20
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,770
This three that takes the.

21
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,610
And test for Tom T60.

22
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,390
OK, so go to main function.

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:53,150
First, we used to get W D function, this function returns a routed past name corresponding to the

24
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,350
current directory.

25
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:01,670
If the current directory can be reached via multiple paths, get W d may return any one of them.

26
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,460
So first, define two variables.

27
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:14,090
Current directory and narrow column equals.

28
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,200
And we'll get WD function from oil spike, it will start get w d

29
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,090
Cheikh error message if.

30
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,880
They're not equals to me.

31
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:38,020
So paint a message for lock the baton.

32
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,270
And of

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,280
now create an E-Trade function that accept a passive string as argument.

34
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,640
So go alotof main function and create a function like form.

35
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,880
Iterate and sit a string as a pass has a string.

36
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,680
Now, we can't want function from foreign press package and initialize it fine pass.

37
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,860
What function

38
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:27,430
it gets to our humans first is past, and second is a watch f and function.

39
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:37,510
So we sit pass and what if an argument fine sit pass as this strange

40
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,370
info as file info from voice package

41
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,650
and e are time is there or.

42
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,980
Return type is a or

43
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:05,470
go to the body and check it or eat it all not equals to Neal.

44
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,700
Like, don't try to laugh at or.

45
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,980
That air now display name of each file and folder.

46
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,710
Check if info is directory, so display folder name.

47
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,920
And if it is a fine, it prints file names.

48
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,480
So do the following.

49
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:42,490
Is the info don't is directory

50
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:50,200
so painful your name, F. A. the plaintiff.

51
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:03,010
Folder named person is in and sit.

52
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,130
Name from the info info, Courtney.

53
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,210
And there's.

54
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,530
If, if.

55
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:40,670
File name first person is back in and said your full name said return for dysfunction and close plants.

56
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,450
Now go to main function and call Iterate.

57
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,880
Go to main function.

58
00:06:50,660 --> 00:07:01,400
And call it raid and said current directory as arguement reformat the code, save the project and execute

59
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,210
the program.

60
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:17,800
Now we can see the output folder, name phones, dash directories, fine name that go to folders, name,

61
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,780
sample and temp on and for Fine's name Test 1.60 until test for that text.

62
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,660
So we could iterate file and folders by the VOC and white Effen functions.

63
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:32,860
OK.

64
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,170
We have reached the end of this session.

65
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,430
I hope you have taken full advantage of this session onto the next session.

66
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,040
Goodbye.
