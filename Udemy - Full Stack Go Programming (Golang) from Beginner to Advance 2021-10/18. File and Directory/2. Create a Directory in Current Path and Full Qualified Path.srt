00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,970
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,020
We talked about create an empty fine and in this session, we want to talk about the other files and

3
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,430
directories concept.

4
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:40,550
Create a directory or folder and go blank in-car DVR function can be used to create a directory or folder

5
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:48,920
and go in the air creates a new directory with the specified name and permission beats.

6
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,820
If there is an error, it will be a time Asterix parser.

7
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,180
Now you can see the syntax.

8
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,140
This function takes into promises.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,890
Name five existing, the first parameter is the name directory.

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,980
If the name directory is a fully qualified pass, it will create a directory at that press.

11
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,080
If not, it'll be create a directory with respect to current working directory.

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,340
Perm type is fine.

13
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,000
The second parameter is specifies the permission beats.

14
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:33,010
Now let's go to this school program to illustrate how to create a directory or folder and go like.

15
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:42,520
First, we want to create a folder or directory at the Fool Qualified Pass by encode the air function.

16
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:51,040
The return value of this function is an error, so we define a variable like e are colon equals.

17
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,870
Invoke ENCODE the our function from OS package

18
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,570
CIT Fool destination via the folder name.

19
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:15,580
For the example, the colon backslash backslash for the example temp and set permission zero seven five

20
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:24,070
five zero seven five five means read and execute access for everyone and authorized access for the owner

21
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,820
of the file.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,750
Now we could create a directory at the foon qualified past name 10, and we assign returns value to

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,070
a variable like error.

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,780
Now we check the print message for us if the error is not empty.

25
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,150
Go to the next line if error not equal, Neal.

26
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,850
In this case, we use the Fartown function of the long package.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Lock the Fattore.

28
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,360
And sit around and sage reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

29
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,210
Now go to drive D

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,630
and select the files and directory by the air.

31
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,830
And now we can see the 10 folder is here.

32
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,630
OK, now let's do another example.

33
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,980
First, create a folder or directory at the current pass.

34
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,770
By the end, call the air function.

35
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:40,270
So two clear the last quote first, defining a variable like error calling equals always start, then

36
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:53,290
called the i r set the folder name like 10th and set version zero seven five five.

37
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:01,870
Now we could create a directory at current pass and name type and the assign return values to a variable

38
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,560
like error.

39
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,180
So we check the print and message for us if the road is not empty.

40
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:22,450
So if they're not equals name from the package like FATTORE and set or reformat the called Save the

41
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,620
Project and execute the program, go to the current pass.

42
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,240
And execute the program.

43
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,280
So we go to diet three of these contests, and we can see the ten folder created here.

44
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,250
Okay.

45
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,560
We could create two directory at court current past and at the Fool Qualified Pass in order not to prolong

46
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
the time of decision.

47
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,780
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

48
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:58,740
Goodbye.
