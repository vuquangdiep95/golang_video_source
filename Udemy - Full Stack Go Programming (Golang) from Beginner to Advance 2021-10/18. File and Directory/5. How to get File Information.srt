00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,860
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,500
In the previous session, we talked about check if a file or directory exists.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,200
And in this section, we want to talk about the other files and directories concept.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,580
Get fine information and go land.

5
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,360
It's that function can be used to the influence of the file and go.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:50,260
This function returns is fast, which can be used to get the name of the fine size of the file in bytes.

7
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,710
Modify time of the file and permission bits or mode of fine.

8
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:05,720
Now you can see the scene techs, this function takes in the named file and return fire and infrastructure,

9
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,890
which defines the utility method to get above information.

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,490
Now let's go to this school with program to illustrate how to get find information.

11
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,420
First, create a file and named it 10 30 60.

12
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:27,350
So define two variables like file and error calling equals.

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,730
Invoke, create function from always package or start.

14
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,040
Create function and set name 10 Dot T60.

15
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:46,730
Now you check the print message for us if there is not empty, if they're not equals to Neal.

16
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:59,360
So like the throttle and set, oh, now we want to write something to the file by the following his

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,040
statement.

18
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:12,960
So we write file dots, write a string and set a message as if string parameter, for the example,

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:22,800
is welcome to go programming language and set back slash.

20
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,470
And now we get this.

21
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:31,070
That's of the file using this that function, which returns defined infrastructure describing fine.

22
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:42,510
So first, we defined two variables like that, and a roll call equals invokes that function from with

23
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,350
the case.

24
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:55,940
Start, start and set name of fine tend to and check to print a message for us if the error is not empty,

25
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,710
if they're not equals mean.

26
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:12,520
Launched that baton and set off now we print estimates of the file by calling fine infrastructure functions

27
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,440
for the example for the term ashes.

28
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,210
We're right if.

29
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:27,530
Share person is back and and said this that got mode

30
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:42,680
and for the size of fine, we can size function if earth size person the bank is close and said it's

31
00:03:42,680 --> 00:04:01,580
the that size and for the name, the coin name function from stats, if any person is back and said

32
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,390
is that?

33
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:17,830
Dot's name and for the modification time we call mod time fonts, and if if modification time person

34
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:29,830
is back is and sets its start that much time and finally close, define so five.

35
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,390
The clothes reform and they called Save the Project and execute the program.

36
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,050
We can see the output first.

37
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,640
We could create a file like 10:40.

38
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:55,780
Then we wrote the information inside it and then by calling the stealth function the access and object

39
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,790
from defined infrastructure.

40
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:04,810
And then we fetched defined information calling function, functional fine infrastructure from object,

41
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:13,270
so we can see television size, name and modification time in order not to prolong the time of decision.

42
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,620
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

43
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,460
Goodbye.
