00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,190
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,580
In the previous session, we talked about creating a directory of folder and indecision.

3
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,480
We want to talk about the other files and directories concept.

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,830
Rename, file or folder.

5
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:42,750
Renamed function can be used to rename a file or folder renal function, renamed or moves all past to

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,580
new purpose.

7
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,710
If Neopets already exist and is not a directory, rename replaces it.

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,480
OS specific restrictions may apply.

9
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,310
Then old past and new paths are different directories.

10
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:05,100
Now you can see the syntax all past and new paths can be fully qualified as the.

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:13,170
If the old and new path doesn't lie in the same directory, then rename function behaves the same as

12
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,880
moving a file or folder.

13
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:23,580
Now let's go to this school program to illustrate how to rename, file or folder and go like.

14
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:34,700
First, create the fine name test in current directory, so we define two variables life by an error

15
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,640
call equals E will create function from always package s that create function and set a name for five

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,130
tiers.

17
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,120
The 60.

18
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:57,300
Now we could create a fine and current directory named Tess, and we assign returned values to two variables

19
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:08,340
like find and or so we check to print the message for us if the error is not empty row not equals need.

20
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,960
We use the federal function of the law kids love at FATTORE and set it all.

21
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:30,930
And then we display a like message for fun, large dance, print and set time.

22
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:43,530
And in the end of the code, we close the fun, find close, reformat the call, save the project and

23
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,880
execute the program.

24
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:58,120
Now you can see that the test that defined created in current directory and paint a large message.

25
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:05,760
You can go to current directory passed by the command, the air and we see the test, the the fine.

26
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,290
OK, now we want to use rename function for change name off fine.

27
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,810
In this case, we want to change fine them to 10th name.

28
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,690
So go to the code.

29
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,700
Define a variable like arrow equals endocrine function from always.

30
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,650
Packages will start rename first set.

31
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,730
Oh, fine.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:44,880
In this case, this test dog takes the corner and sets a name for new fine, for the example turned

33
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,200
out to.

34
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:58,290
Now we check the print, a message for us, if the error is not into is the rule not equals need.

35
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:08,520
We use the fatal function of the large package, large dots that are set out or reformat the code,

36
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,640
save the project and execute the program.

37
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:26,080
Now we can see the name of text, the text changed to 10th and fine like message printed so we can go

38
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,620
to current directory passed by the Air Command.

39
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:39,340
And we can see the test that the file has changed to 10 dot so we could use from rename function to

40
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,110
change a file name.

41
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,490
Now let's rename a folder together first.

42
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,890
Clear the last code.

43
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,070
Say the project and it's ready to right first, create a folder or directory at the current pass by

44
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:10,950
the end Kar di R function define a variable like error calling equals invoke encode di R function from

45
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,180
all.

46
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:20,300
This package will start in K D, R R and set a folder name like 10

47
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,780
and set permission zero seven five.

48
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:35,750
By now, we could create a directory, a common past name temp, and we assign return value to a variable

49
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,490
like ETL.

50
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,280
Now we take the print a message for us.

51
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:50,450
If the error is not empty, e error not equals name be used from the federal function of long package

52
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:59,960
large docs, fatty acids or reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

53
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,430
Now we can see the ten folder created, and we can go to the current directory passed by the comment,

54
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,030
the air and we see Tan folder created here.

55
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,550
OK, now we use rename function for change and name of directory.

56
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,560
In this case, we want to change tan name to new folder.

57
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:35,560
So first clear, the last code define a variable like error calling it equals invoke, rename function

58
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,460
or worse.

59
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,510
Package Voice got renamed and set all directory name.

60
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:53,830
In this case, it is tan and set a name for new folder like new folder.

61
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:06,400
OK, check to print a message for us if the error is not only if error not equals to mean we use the

62
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:16,480
federal function of like package, log the button and sit there or reformat the court, save the project

63
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,210
and execute the program.

64
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:31,890
Now we can see the Tan folder has changed to new folder me and we can go to the current directory passed

65
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:40,800
by the Air Command and we can see Tan Folder has changed to new folder in order not to prolong.

66
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,900
The time of this session will finished and we will continue the content in the next session.

67
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,710
Goodbye.
