00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,750
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course.

2
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:26,030
In this session, we want to talk about create an example for lead and ride the fine and go language.

3
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,350
In this sample, the user is supposed to receive information from the council and save the received

4
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,190
information inside the file and then read the information is stored inside the file and display it.

5
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,410
Now let's go to this school for a year to read and write the fine.

6
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:55,510
First, create a function named create fine for creative fine and write data inside it.

7
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,300
In this function, we defined two parameters pass file name and find content.

8
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,180
So define

9
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,270
foreign.

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,430
Create five set two parameters first, find the.

11
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,830
And second, text and type of there is a strike.

12
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:32,320
Creating the file using create function, which user interrupted fine name and or variable so defined

13
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:43,200
by comma here equals in create fun from Westpac case or start, create fine and set file name.

14
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:55,010
Now we check to print a message for us if the error is not empty, so right, if error not equals to

15
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:55,520
mean.

16
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:13,440
Colin Fatalis from launch function last Saturday, left and right, a message failed to create five

17
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,810
column percentages and set a rule value about.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,360
Now, closing the running fine after the main method has completed the execution and the writing to

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,650
the file is complete.

20
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:38,000
So views from different keyboard differ and close the font file close.

21
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,230
Now writing data to the using write history, so first define tool variable.

22
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,050
First, Len and Edward Cullen equals fine dot.

23
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,640
Write a string.

24
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,310
And it takes.

25
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:07,290
As our humans now we take to create a message for us, if the error is not empty, if a row not equals

26
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:16,680
to mean so fat on Earth, from large package life to fatal Earth and Saturn message hail

27
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,580
writing

28
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,090
to fire color, cursing Earth and such error message.

29
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,100
Now print name and lengths of function by following code.

30
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:49,130
If bank is less than five, nine per cent is set by that name.

31
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,850
If if.

32
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,800
I guess less and less.

33
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Colin, persons since the Whites said, Len, very.

34
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,980
Reformat the code, then save the project, we were able to create a function that receives two parameters

35
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,670
can't find a name and file content as takes from the outside, then creates the desired file and is

36
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,490
supposed to receive information inside the phone.

37
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,850
Now we want to create the function to read and display the information is stored and defined.

38
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:35,540
First, create a function name, Redefine and set the parameters fine name, phone.

39
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:45,380
Read fine and set a parameter name by name as a stream.

40
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,310
Display a message based on reading fine information.

41
00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:00,060
The fear that is less and reading the.

42
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:13,510
To read data from DeFi, the use redefine function of AI or UTIL package redefine function reads the

43
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,350
fine named by file name and returns the contents.

44
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:25,480
This function returns to variables as bias area, and they're also first defined to variable like data

45
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,580
and URL column equals.

46
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,910
Invoke redefined function from AI to take each dot read fine.

47
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:46,150
And sit fine, Amos arguements fine name in case of an error, the erroneous statement is printed and

48
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:53,980
program is a start, so we'll be right if are not equal to mean.

49
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:06,810
We use from panic, a function from like package locked door punch if and set a message, fail.

50
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:16,270
Reading data from five columns per cent is an said error of value that.

51
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,080
In this case, we display fine line lengths of fine and fine contents by the following code.

52
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,010
Defensive back slash and fine name calling.

53
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,350
Yes, and set fire and then variable.

54
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:54,540
If Earth patches list and size per cent the ice and set then of data.

55
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,490
Variable and back, yes, list and data.

56
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,760
Colin Person is said data, right?

57
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,800
Reformat the code and save the project.

58
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:19,660
Now we were able to create the function that receives defined name as an input parameter and then reads

59
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,410
the information inside the received file and display it.

60
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:31,630
Now we can create two functions one function to create the fine and save the information inside it and

61
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,590
the other function to read the existing information from the fire.

62
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:43,690
It's time for the user to receive information from the council inside the main function and to write

63
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:48,730
and read the information by calling the functions created in the main method.

64
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,460
So go to main function.

65
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:06,170
User input for finding the first display, a message to let the user know that they need to enter information

66
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:12,050
FP into by name

67
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,990
and define a variable for assigned file name to it by using its own function.

68
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:36,020
First, define the variable like that file name type is a string and define 2.0 scanlon and set and

69
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,410
person file name.

70
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,430
Now, using input for five content, we do this again.

71
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:53,340
First display a message to let the user know that they need to enter information, so write F.P. into

72
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,740
text

73
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,200
to read information from the council.

74
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:08,120
We use for a new reader function that returns in new reader, whose buffer has the default size and

75
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:15,290
assign it to a variable like input reader input reader.

76
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:29,420
Column equals invokes new reader function from both I or package, while I o but new reader and sit

77
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:37,130
a standard input as argued or stored listed in now.

78
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:44,960
Views from reader soon function for reading the text reader string function reads until the first occurrence

79
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,800
of delimiter in the input returning Estyn containing date data up to and including the delimiter.

80
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:58,610
If we string encounters an error before finding a delimiter, it retains the date on read before the

81
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,200
error and error itself.

82
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,140
So first, define the variable like improved chrome on a school call.

83
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,960
It equals input reader

84
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,260
dot reader string.

85
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:24,920
We set a delimiter for the example backslash and either able to receive the information from the outside

86
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,700
environment.

87
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:34,910
Now we have to write and read and display it again to their to existing functions inside, define first

88
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:42,630
involved, create file function and post two variables file name as foreign name and input as file content

89
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:51,080
to either create fine first, finally and second input.

90
00:10:53,590 --> 00:11:00,940
Then invoke redefine function and pacifying them as argument to fetch data from five fold, we write,

91
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:10,600
read fine and certified nay, reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

92
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,510
Inter Define, named for the example, test the RTX three.

93
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,550
Initiatives.

94
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:30,140
Hello and welcome to go programming.

95
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,100
Language

96
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:44,820
now we can see the output file name is pierced, the text length is 46 bytes reading a fine and then

97
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,380
again fine, then test.

98
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,340
The text size is for six bytes and data.

99
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:50,580
Please.

100
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,440
Hello and welcome to go programming language.

101
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,720
We were able to get the information from the console right, eat in the phone and then read the information

102
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,410
from the file and display it in order not to prolong the time of decision to will finish it, and we

103
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,910
will continue the content in the next session.

104
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,490
Goodbye.
