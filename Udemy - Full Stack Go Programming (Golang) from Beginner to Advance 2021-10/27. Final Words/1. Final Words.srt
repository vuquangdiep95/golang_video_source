00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,780
Dear friends, we have reached to the end of this training course.

2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:25,150
I hope this course has been useful enough for you in this course and attend was made to reveal all the

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:31,420
details of go for academy language and separate examples were presented for all sections.

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,400
If you have any problem in the section, review that section carefully and do the examples again, then

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:47,740
make examples by your own as well and always remember the more exercises you do, the more professional

6
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,550
you will be.

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,500
Now you are be able to do various programmes in different fields, including software design and development,

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,670
implementation of web applications and communication with clients, and implementation of various games

9
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,530
and communication programmes.

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,780
Since you have completely reviewed concepts of database and go in framework services, including RESTful

11
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:21,220
and You PC to communicate with other services and applications that socket concepts for game implementation

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,060
and real time programmes like chat applications.

13
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:34,210
Let's look at some of these programmes, which you are now able to write and implement network distribution

14
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,930
services.

15
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,900
Create your own distributed services and contribute to open source projects.

16
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:49,360
For example, you are able to build network secured clients and server BGR PC kind of native development.

17
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:56,590
The synchronous features of Google and its high portability makes it sweeter that for building native

18
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:03,460
cloud applications and GO has been used to build several cloud computing platforms, including Docker

19
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,490
and Kubernetes is an alternative for existing infrastructure.

20
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:17,500
Another advantage of good language is that many of the softwares we need to use for internet infrastructure

21
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,010
are aging and have many security holes.

22
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,240
Rewriting such items in GO has many benefits.

23
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,040
Better memory security.

24
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,880
Easier deployment of cross-platform and clean cut base for future upgrades are some examples.

25
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,940
Independent facilities and tools.

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,590
Another advantage of go language is that girl programs are compiled with minimal external dependencies,

27
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,590
either binary, which makes them ideal for creating utilities and other tools.

28
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:59,440
Since the Iran quickly and can be easily repaired for redistribution, I hope you have enjoyed this

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,090
course and wish you all the best.

30
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,630
Looking forward to meeting you in our next tutorial.

31
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,650
Goodbye.
