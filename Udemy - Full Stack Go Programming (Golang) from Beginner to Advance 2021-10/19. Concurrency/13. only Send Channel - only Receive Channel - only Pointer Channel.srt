00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,540
Hello and welcome to the and programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,870
We want to talk about the others concurrency concept.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,670
Only send China signature of Sergeant Sergeant Shannon, to which only you can send will be like below

4
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,730
when passed to a function as an argument.

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:45,480
Now let's go to the school for a grant to illustrate only sent China first create a function that accept

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,960
our government as a channel to which only you can send.

7
00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:00,060
So we write foreign trusts set a variable like C-H.

8
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,090
By the time Chan Chan, an operator and eight.

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,350
And set a value through a channel, for example, search channel operator to.

10
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:22,160
Now go to main function and create a channel and pass it to a process function.

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:33,620
So define the variable like C-H calling equals and calling may function by the time channel end.

12
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,450
And, for example, the Triassic hand argument now calling process and set channels.

13
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:50,000
Argument Process said See us as arguments go to the next line and display M.A.S.H.

14
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,620
He

15
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,390
search the format they call, save the project and execute the program.

16
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,130
Go from dot.

17
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,030
Righteousness may not go.

18
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,960
Now we can see the output, we could send the value through a channel.

19
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,910
Now given to receive data from channel, so define a variable in process function and get channel value.

20
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,200
Value equals channel operator and search.

21
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,000
Reformat the code and see the project.

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,230
So we see then trying to receive data from a channel.

23
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,820
It has an arrow, solve the armistice line and execute again.

24
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,400
Now we can see the value of channel.

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,510
We could send the value to a channel and could not receive its value in a goal routine because the function

26
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:01,100
just accept arguement as a channel to which only send data, go to the slides and continue.

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:13,040
Only receive China Sea nature of this sorted channels from peace, you can only receive data will be

28
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,420
like below when passed to a function as an unit.

29
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,130
Now, let's go to this school curriculum to illustrate only receive China first year, the last quote

30
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,620
create a function that accept arguement as a channel to which only you can receive.

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:47,690
So we ride for process defining the value of a light switch channel operator channel by the time we.

32
00:03:50,790 --> 00:04:01,820
Define a variable like value call equals channel operator, search and display the value FP

33
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,670
right

34
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,250
now, go to main function, create a channel and pass it to process function.

35
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:25,680
So define the variable like search call and equals calling make function channel by the time end and

36
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:34,790
the for second or unit, and send a value to create a channel search channel operator.

37
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,430
For example.

38
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:46,370
10 value now calling process and search channels argument to each go process and channel as argument.

39
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,720
Go to the next line and display.

40
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,700
Create a channel FP.

41
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,850
Can operate or see its reformat, they could save the project and execute the program.

42
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,200
Now we can see the output, we could receive the value to a channel.

43
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,030
But we want to send data to China, so write this code in process function.

44
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,660
See its channel operator.

45
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,550
50.

46
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,040
Even trying to send data to such a end will give it.

47
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,120
So, I mean, to design and execute programming again.

48
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,770
We could receive the value of a channel and could not send its value in a go routine because the function

49
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:46,570
just acts arguement as a channel to which only receive data, go to the slides and continue.

50
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:58,020
Shannon Poynter, this way of passing your channel would only make sense if you would want to modify

51
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,530
the channel.

52
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:06,210
This is very uncommon and not a profitable way to use signature off such a channel, which is pass as

53
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:06,870
a pointer.

54
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:14,430
Now let's go to your school program on to illustrate Channel Point to her first career the last quote.

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,990
Define a function that accept arguement as a channel pointer.

56
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,110
So you right from a process, set a variable like C age.

57
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:45,740
By the time a pointer changed, hands send the value to a channel pointer asterisk, see its channel

58
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:51,620
operator and send the value like to receive data from a channel pointer.

59
00:06:52,100 --> 00:07:00,830
First, define the variable light is calling equals channel operator and asterisk C-H

60
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:17,370
and sits nil value to channel pointer asterisk search equals need now display the value of Channel FP.

61
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,560
Yes.

62
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,270
Now go to main function to create a chanin and positive process function.

63
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,380
Define the variable not see as column equals.

64
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:40,730
Make function by the time in and three a second argument calling process function and set arguments

65
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,340
as a channel pointer process.

66
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:56,530
And sit for some serious barrier business as arguments to eat this that H.A. saw you right, FP see

67
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,560
its reform at, they could save the projects and execute the program.

68
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,130
Go round the back.

69
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,760
Bush made that call.

70
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,100
Now we can see the output.

71
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:19,340
We could send and receive data to channel by Poynter in order not to prolong the time of decision.

72
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,170
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

73
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,890
Goodbye.
