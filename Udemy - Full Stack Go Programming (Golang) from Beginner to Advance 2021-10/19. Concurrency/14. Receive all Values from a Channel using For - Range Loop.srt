00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,070
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,340
We want to talk about the others concurrency concepts.

3
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,890
Receive all values from a channel by full range, look full range, Lou can be used to receive data

4
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,940
from the channel until it is closed for days.

5
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,690
Lou will keep receiving from the channel.

6
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,900
The only way for range Lou to exit is to close the channel.

7
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,550
Now let's go to Villa School curriculum to talk about it.

8
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,280
First, create a function that accept a challenge as argument and iterate on channel value and support

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,810
on off channel values together.

10
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,950
So we write for each song and define the value of a life series.

11
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,540
By the time it

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:19,890
first define, a variable like sum equals zero and define the full range loop for value.

13
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,110
Calling equals branch in search.

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:39,540
And some the value of Channel Together, Song Plus equals value and end of the work of the follow up,

15
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:53,320
we displayed a total of somebody of a f f song total to Colin Firth and the brackets and and set value

16
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,540
the song.

17
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:05,820
Now go to main function and create a channel and send data to it, then call and go routine and pass

18
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,160
these generous argument of function.

19
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:23,590
Now, create a channel like search calling equals killing, make function and sit chan and and Triassic

20
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:34,630
in argument now set values to the channel search channel operate on our set to see its channel operator

21
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,750
answer to a game and see its channel operator and said two values to the channel.

22
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:49,520
Now, Carlos create a channel by the close function, close and set seizures or argument now calling

23
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Go Routine and pause channel to eat, song and toss Sia's tweet as our unit.

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:08,320
And in the end of the work of function, we said at timeously time, Dot's lead time that millisecond

25
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:18,010
multiplication 200 OK, reformat the court, save the project and execute the program, go round the

26
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,350
clock.

27
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:27,460
This means that Google now we can see the output song total is six in above program.

28
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,030
First, we created a channel in the main function.

29
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,010
We sent three values to the channel and after death we closed the channel.

30
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,250
Then we called the song function and we passed the channel to that function in the song function.

31
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,010
We did the full range loop over the channel.

32
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:51,070
After iterating over all the values in the channel and the full range, no bill exists since the channel

33
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,820
is closed.

34
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,670
Now the question which comes to the mind is that what happens if you don't close the channel in the

35
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,540
main function?

36
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,390
Now go to main function and commenting the line in which they are closing the channel in and around

37
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,620
the program again.

38
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,170
Save the project and execute the program again.

39
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,730
Now we can see the output.

40
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,870
We have error.

41
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:23,110
It will answer output deadlock because full range loop will never finish in the song function.

42
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,170
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

43
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,010
the next session.

44
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,760
Goodbye.
