00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,680
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in this session, we want to talk about

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,810
the others concurrency concept.

3
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:31,980
Length and capacity of a channel and go lengths, as well as capacity only applies to the Beaufort channel.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,700
The length of the channel is the number of elements that are already during the channel, whereas the

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,800
capacity of the buffer channel is the number of elements which the channel can hold.

6
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,840
So length actually represents the number of elements keyed in the buffer of the channel, while capacity

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,630
refers to the size of the buffer of the channel.

8
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,560
Hence, the length of the channel is owned weighs less than or equal to the capacity of the channel.

9
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:08,910
Length function can be used to get the length of the channel, and chat function can be used to get

10
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,410
the capacity off the channel.

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,480
Length and capacity up on Beaufort Channel is always zero.

12
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:23,220
Now let's go to this school with program to illustrate how to find the capacity of the channel first,

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,690
creating a channel using make function and set capacity for it.

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:37,230
For example, define a variable like C-H calling equals and in which main function sip and integer variable

15
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,930
like Channel 18th and set five as capacity argument.

16
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:50,790
Now set data to Channel Channel Channel Operator and send 10 value for it.

17
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,240
Now finding the length and capacity of the channel using lean in channel functions.

18
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:10,440
So you're right, if Len Caller first and the back is lost, he and Colin Glen function and passes as

19
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,110
arguments to eat and go to the next line.

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,830
If if!

21
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:27,120
And Cha Caller first, then the back is left hand and invoking chat function and sets this variable

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,470
as arguments to it.

23
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:40,710
Now set another data to Tichina Sea Edge channel operator, for example, send 20 value to the channel

24
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,200
and again finding the length and capacity of the channel.

25
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,420
So copied these two lines.

26
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:57,660
And paste here for new value of the channel and a gain, said the other data, showing that, for example,

27
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,690
search channel operator and send 30 value to the internet.

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,130
And again finding the length and capacity of the channel.

29
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:16,140
So paste these two lines here again, the format they code, save the projects and execute the program.

30
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,310
Go from that fake, useless name that glow.

31
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,960
Now we can see the out in the above code, the first created the channel of capacity fine after death

32
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,370
that we keep sending some value to the channel, as you can notice from your output that after each

33
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,660
sent operation to the lengths up channel increases by one, while capacity is always the same, which

34
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,230
is fine.

35
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,630
So we could fetch lengths and capacity of channel by the LAN in cap functions in order not to prolong

36
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,860
the time of decision.

37
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,850
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

38
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,570
Goodbye.
