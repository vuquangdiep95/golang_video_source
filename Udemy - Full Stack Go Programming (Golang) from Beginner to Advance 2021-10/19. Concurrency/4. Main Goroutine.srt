00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:17,650
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,890
We want to talk about the others concurrency concept.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,390
Main goal, pretty.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,650
The main function in the main package is the main goal written on go routines are started from the main

5
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,340
goal routine.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,080
These go routines can then assault multiple on a regular routine and so on.

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,280
The main goal routine represents the main program.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,080
Once it exists, then it means that the program has exited goal routines don't have parents or children.

9
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:58,220
When you start to go routines, it just executes alongside all other running goal routines.

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,900
Its goal routines exist only when its function returns.

11
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,160
The only exception to that is that old goal routines exceed when the main goal routine exists.

12
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,450
Now, let's go to this code program to demonstrate that goal routines don't have parents or children.

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:32,700
First defined two functions like Halo one and Halo two, Funk Halo one, and defining a statement like

14
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:48,000
FP and Go Routine one and define another function like Halo three, find and Low two and set to statement

15
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,220
for response like RFP

16
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,730
in the routine to

17
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,970
now call Halo to function in Halo one function as go routine.

18
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,210
So go to the Halo one function.

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,980
Go Halo two.

20
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:27,690
Now go to the main function and cognitive function is go routine, go to the main function and calling

21
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,750
Hello, one has gold.

22
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,050
Right, some other statements like AFP.

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,790
Hello.

24
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,630
And put sleep time like time to sleep

25
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:59,250
and set while my application time got sick.

26
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:10,080
And again, another message is go to the next line and if to, for example, goodbye.

27
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,520
Reformat the quote, save the process and execute the program.

28
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,680
Go round back.

29
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,140
Let me go

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,740
now we can see the output.

31
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:36,030
Hello, in-goal routine one, you can go routine two and goodbye in the above program, the first go

32
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,590
routine source and preens in go routine one and then exists the second goretti and then source and proteins

33
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:51,210
in go protein to its shows that go proteins don't have parents or children, and they exist as an independent

34
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,930
execution in order not to prolong the time of decision.

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,800
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session until next session.

36
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,260
Goodbye.
