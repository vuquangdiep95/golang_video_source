00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,980
Hello and welcome to the kulang programming language course.

2
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,960
In this session, we want to talk about the others concurrency concepts.

3
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,130
Channel as Fonctionne, are you man to go?

4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,040
There are many ways in which it can and can be passed as a function argument.

5
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:42,890
The direction of the arrow for a channel specifies the direction of flow of data channel bi directional

6
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,340
channel.

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:53,330
Both read and write channel channel operator on the writing channel channel operator channel on the

8
00:00:53,330 --> 00:01:01,580
reading from the Channel, the input channel, Asterix Channel Channel Pointer both read and write.

9
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:10,190
BI directional channel signature of such a bi directional channel will be light below, then pass to

10
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,110
a function as an argument.

11
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,930
Now let's go to a school with program to illustrate by of Shannon Channel.

12
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,630
First, create a function that accept the channel as argument.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,730
Solve you right?

14
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,310
Find, for example, process.

15
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,200
Set a variable like search by the time of each.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,190
Sent a value to Channel C H channel operator, for example, send a value like 10.

17
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:58,620
Received value off channel and display, it defines a value to like value calling equals channel operator

18
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,690
and CSI event and display it FP

19
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:14,670
Value now go to main function and create a channel and positive process function.

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:28,200
So define a value like search Collins equals and consummate function channel for you to come in and

21
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,680
sit.

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:38,970
For example, try a second argument now counting process and set channel as arguement go, process and

23
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,560
sit c is a channel are human to process function.

24
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,510
Now go to the next line and put a time asleep.

25
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,450
Time to sleep.

26
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,310
For example, one multiplication time.

27
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:07,870
The second reform that the court said the projects and execute the program go from, that the bank is

28
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:15,250
dismaying that quote now we can see the output, we could send a value through a channel and receive

29
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:22,130
its value in a gold routine by the buffer China in order not to prolong the time of decision.

30
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,200
You will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

31
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,950
Goodbye.
