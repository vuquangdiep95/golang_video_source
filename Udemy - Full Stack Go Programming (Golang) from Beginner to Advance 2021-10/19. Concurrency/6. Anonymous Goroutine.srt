00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,540
Hello and welcome to the godowns programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,870
We want to talk about the orders concurrency concept.

3
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,240
Anonymous girl routine.

4
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,400
In good language, you can also sort go rooting for an anonymous function or, in other words, you

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,150
can create an anonymous glow routine simple by using go keyboard as a prefix of that function.

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,930
Now you can see the syntax.

7
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,690
There is no difference in behavior through when calling an anonymous function using go writing or calling

8
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,650
a normal function using gold.

9
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:04,170
Now, let's go to this school program to illustrate how to create an anonymous school routine.

10
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,800
First, write a message for interim main function.

11
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:23,500
If hello, hello to name function, now creating an anonymous call written for the example.

12
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:32,990
Go find open and close parentheses, curly braces and end of closed braces.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,300
We sit and order open and closed practices and in the between open and closed curly braces, we sit

14
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,150
as statements.

15
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:50,030
For example, FP Welcome to Girl Rules

16
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,860
now set a sleep time and statement for exit from main function.

17
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,080
Time does sleep.

18
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,320
One Multiplication time start second.

19
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,240
And so the message is that, for example, if the good by.

20
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,440
Reformat the code, save the project and execute the program, go wrong.

21
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,240
Back this made that go.

22
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,480
Now we can see the output.

23
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,490
Two main function.

24
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,490
Welcome to go routine and goodbye.

25
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,090
So we could define an anonymous score routine in order not to prolong the time of decision.

26
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,140
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

27
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,880
Goodbye.
