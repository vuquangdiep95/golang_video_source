00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,770
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,330
We want to talk about database concept.

3
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,480
What is data?

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:34,720
Data is nothing but information that is collected in various formats, such as numbers, text, media

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:43,060
and others in the context of computing, data can be converted into a binary digital form that enables

6
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,900
flexibility to be moved around and processed efficiently.

7
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,020
The term data can be used either as singular or plural from time to time.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,690
We come across the term raw data.

9
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:06,930
It is nothing but data in its most basic digital format, as data grew potentiality over the years.

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,740
The units of data measurement continue to grow as well.

11
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,540
Databases, database management systems or VMS and relational database management systems.

12
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,310
Or are they business quickly rounds to organize all these data?

13
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,020
What is data this?

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,460
The database is a systematic or organized collection of related information that is this stored in such

15
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,260
a way that it can be easily accessed, retrieved, managed and off date.

16
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,170
It is where all data is stored.

17
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:53,250
Very much like a library that houses a wide range of books from different genders, think of data as

18
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,920
books in a database.

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,960
You can organize the data in rows and columns in the form of a table.

20
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:08,190
Indexing the data makes it easy to find and retrieve the gain as and when required.

21
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:16,450
Many of its sights on the World Wide Web on engaged with the help of databases to create a database

22
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:23,380
so that the data is accessible to users through only one set of software programs, database handlers

23
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:31,690
are used more obscure, obscure server MongoDB, Oracle database, post-career school informatics,

24
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,190
seabass and etc. are all examples of different databases.

25
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,450
These modern databases are managed by the IBM's.

26
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,740
The Structure Query language or eschew it as it is more widely known, is used to operate on the data

27
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,640
in the database.

28
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,590
A database is typically represented by a cylindrical structure.

29
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,650
Database languages.

30
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:09,100
A deepness pill was appropriate language to use it to help quell databases and updates.

31
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,540
It essentially creates and maintains the database.

32
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:23,290
Some examples of database language are Stuart ORADUR, DBAs, A. Access Sports, Bryan, etc. Database

33
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:31,270
languages are commonly divided into data definition, language or detailed data control language or

34
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:40,630
DCA data manipulation, language or email and transaction control language or TCO data definition.

35
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:49,570
Language, or DDL, has defined data and the relationship to the other data types and creates databases,

36
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:59,860
finds tables and data dictionaries within databases, data control language or DC, and controls access

37
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,420
to data and the database.

38
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:10,410
Data manipulation, language or DNA, supports basic data manipulation operations like allowing the

39
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,630
user to insert, retrieve updates and delete data from the database.

40
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:25,100
And transaction control language, or C, manages changes in the database made by the DMR, the statement.

41
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,600
Types of databases.

42
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,690
There are various types of databases used for storing different varieties of data.

43
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,660
Relational databases, it is the most efficient way to access the structured information.

44
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,860
The data is organized into a set of tables that has columns and rules object oriented database.

45
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,340
Here, the data is represented in the form of object as in object oriented programming.

46
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,590
Distributed database It has two or more files located in different places.

47
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:18,030
The database may be in the same physical location on multiple computers or is scattered over different

48
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,750
networks.

49
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,180
No Escuela database.

50
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,840
Noel Stewart is a no relational database that contains on a structured and semi unstructured data.

51
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,310
It rose in popularity as web applications came to be commonly used and became more complex.

52
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:46,120
Graph database It installs data in the form of entities and the relationships between then centralization

53
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:54,190
database CPB DB is located, is taught and maintained in a single centralized location, for example,

54
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:03,280
a mainframe computer or desktop or server CPU operational database, also known as Old TCP or online

55
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,470
transactional processing database.

56
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,550
It is designed to create or update big amounts of data, and this sort transactions performed by multiple

57
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,180
users in real time data warehouses.

58
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,030
It is a central repository for data.

59
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:27,460
It holds current and historical data in a single location for analytical reporting throughout the enterprise.

60
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,100
Advantages of databases.

61
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,800
Minimum data redundancy.

62
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,990
Improved data security.

63
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,000
Increased consistency.

64
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,830
Lower updating errors.

65
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,560
Reduced cost of data entry.

66
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,680
Data storage and data retrieval.

67
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,800
Improved data access using haast and courier languages.

68
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,540
And higher data integrity from application programs.

69
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,200
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

70
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,190
the next session.

71
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,060
Goodbye.
