00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,900
Hello and welcome to the golems programming language course.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,560
In this session, we want to create a database called person and then create a table inside it called

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:40,290
A-student, which contains the fields of IED name and age, then connect go blank to my school database

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,950
and be able to perform current operations through its.

5
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,470
Creating a database.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:01:00,070
Before doing anything, we need to create a database so that we can install our tables in the Create

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,570
database, that statement is used to create a new school database.

8
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,480
Now you can see the syntax.

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,580
It's time to go to my school database to do crack operations using different queries.

10
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:26,920
Opened the MySchool database, click on my school connection and enter your passport.

11
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:39,400
In the left side, the window in Navigator section, you can see the Eskimos database, for example,

12
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,000
using my database like contact and my project.

13
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,230
Now we go to define menu and select New Query tab for creating our queries.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,410
Find New Query Tap.

15
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,900
First, we want to create a database which the name person.

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,060
So we write query statement.

17
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,360
Create database person.

18
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,900
Now press conference in order to execute our query or press execute button for run query.

19
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,860
In the Navigator panel, right click and select Refresh on.

20
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,770
Then we will see the created database in the person name.

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,810
Now we were able to create first query in the MySchool database.

22
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,300
Go to his lines and continue.

23
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:57,150
Create Table, a database table is a structure that organizes data into rows and columns forming agreed.

24
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:05,920
Creating a basic table involves naming the table and defining its columns and its columns, data type

25
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,130
tables are similar to evoke sheets in spreadsheet applications.

26
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,890
The creative in a statement is used to create a new table in a database.

27
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,340
Now you can see the syntax.

28
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,980
Column name.

29
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,500
Name of the party cooler, Colin, with any space.

30
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:38,580
Column type, data, type of the column data type depends upon the data of the reference column data

31
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:49,170
time can be cad vodka and float and etc. constraints in order to get restrictions to a particular column,

32
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,700
countries are used.

33
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,190
Countries can be not known primary key, foreign key and et cetera.

34
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,960
These are the key laws which give set up restrictions to the particular column.

35
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,790
Now go to MySchool database to create a new query.

36
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,210
First, clear the last query.

37
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,360
We want to create the table in person database with the name A-student, so people write the new query.

38
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,310
Select database by the common use database name, so write clearly.

39
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,780
Statement use person.

40
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,730
And go to the next line.

41
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,460
It's time to create a student table.

42
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:46,730
We want this student table to contain I'd feel of type integer name filled by the variety and age feel

43
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,260
of integer type.

44
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,970
So we write query for create a student table by these attributes.

45
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,650
Create Table.

46
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,150
A student opened prances this.

47
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:20,750
Field name, I.D. And it's time, is it I.D. in and visit the car's right name, not known, which indicates

48
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,780
that this field cannot have an end to value?

49
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,840
No, it's not.

50
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,770
And auto increment, which indicates that if we don't enter the I devalue, the database will automatically

51
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,140
generate its value sequentially.

52
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,310
Auto increments, said Karma.

53
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:51,290
Next, see here is the name attribute and its top is viajar and sit 50 characters for it.

54
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,040
Name that chair

55
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,770
and sit 15th.

56
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,440
It represents the string and set.

57
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,090
Not small constraints.

58
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,930
Not.

59
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,740
Said sitcom and Nick's food is age and its time is end.

60
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,730
A.

61
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,010
Paint and sit, come on.

62
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:40,020
And finally, we defined the IED field as the primary key in the table by the primary key constraints.

63
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:50,100
So we ride primary key and in open and close prone to this IED.

64
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,710
And Close prompted this and said a semicolon.

65
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,810
Now a press conference in order to execute our query.

66
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,450
In the navigation panel, right click and select Refresh on.

67
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:20,390
Then we select person database and go to Table Salt menu, and we can see the create table named student.

68
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,480
So we could create a table named students in order not to prolong the time of decision.

69
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,830
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

70
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,520
Goodbye.
