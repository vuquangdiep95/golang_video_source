00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,610
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,360
We want to create another function to update student in student table in person database.

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,250
So go to the TV connection, find and created our new function.

4
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:41,060
First, define it function named update that accept student object as parameter and returns the number

5
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,170
of rows affected.

6
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:55,040
So we write phone update set a parameter as a student by the time the student of modern.

7
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,860
And return times and 64 value

8
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,250
next calling clinic function for initializing my screwdriver name and data source name.

9
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,820
First, define a variable like call calling equals and calling conic function.

10
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,190
Use D3 for closing.

11
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,060
Create a TV object, the Ether TV dot close.

12
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,210
After creating a DV object from a school package, the Invoke prepper method that creates a prepared

13
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:46,410
statement for later callers or executioner's multiple queries or executions may be run concurrently

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,360
from the return to the statement.

15
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,850
This function returns to values.

16
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,030
First isn't the object from a school package that is a prepared statement, and the order is erotic.

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,740
So first, define two variables like object and or update comma.

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:14,820
Column equals and calling prepar function on the object DB to prepare now, write suitable query for

19
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,200
object and object.

20
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,510
So we write update.

21
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,820
A student.

22
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Said name.

23
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:41,020
Equals instead of value, we said question mark and age equals sit and other question marks instead

24
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:52,720
of value for age and set virtual laws as condition where I.D. equals and sit and other question mark.

25
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,090
Okay.

26
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:04,210
Go to the next line and check a status if there are a lot of that error that they are

27
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,650
now cutting exec method from a school package and executes a prepared statement with the given arguments

28
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,090
and returns a result summarizing the effect of this statement.

29
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:26,290
This method returns to value first and object of result interface, and the other is and a raw object

30
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:37,270
so defined to Abi's life result and error result, comma error column equals and column exit function

31
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,800
on the update object update dot exec.

32
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,950
And so the student fills as parameter instead question marks in further statements sequentially.

33
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,020
First, the student may.

34
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,540
Second, a student at age.

35
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,230
And sit a student IDs condition for their clothes.

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,550
Student got I.D..

37
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,090
Now, take Aurora status.

38
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,160
Now, cutting roads affect effective function from a school package that returns the number of roads

39
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,520
affected by an update, insert or delete.

40
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,380
Not every database or database driver may support this.

41
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,720
This function returns to values first in 1864, when you and the other is, aren't there?

42
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:49,870
Or so we write two variables like roads affected and it all roads affected.

43
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:57,430
Comma L equals resolved dirt roads affected.

44
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,690
Go to the next line and check error status.

45
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,750
And return roads affected as return value later.

46
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,180
No.

47
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,350
But that reform of the court and say the project now, we could define the function name update that

48
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:27,070
accepted a student object as parameter and object that we call into the student table in person database

49
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,190
and returns the roles affected?

50
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,800
No.

51
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:37,060
Before we move on to go to the main function, we go to the MySchool database and see a student table

52
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,710
first, execute the select query for see the records of a student TV.

53
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:52,210
In the student table, we have a record by the values I before name Jessica and age 20, and we want

54
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,730
to change the value of this record.

55
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,150
So we go to the main function and create this query first.

56
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,420
We're the last quote

57
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,530
we could see a student with the idea.

58
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:13,480
Number four is existing student table, and we won't change the name and age values of it.

59
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,990
So create an instance of a student from a student distraught and initialize it.

60
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:29,830
First, define a variable like a student calling equals model dot student and initialize fields of this

61
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,370
object.

62
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,320
We want to change AI before.

63
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,600
So sit for four.

64
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,080
Decide.

65
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,760
And we want to change the name of Jessica to Jean.

66
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:56,110
So that came when you and you want to change the value of age from 20 to 30 age 30.

67
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:04,210
OK, now quick update function from DevTools package and sent created a student object as arguments

68
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,140
to it first define a variable like rose effect.

69
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:22,360
The rolls effect colored equals and calling update function from DevTools DevTools Dot update and set

70
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,180
a student arguements go to the next line and display Rove's effect value.

71
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:38,740
If the rules factor and set variable rules affect,

72
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,940
reformat the code and save the project and execute the program.

73
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,920
Go from the outback is clutch man made that go?

74
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:07,070
Now we can see the output rose affected one, go to the Maya school and see the changes I before the

75
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,900
name is Jessica and ages 20, now execute the select query and see changes.

76
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,840
Yes, the I.D. number for the name has changed too keen and ages 30.

77
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:27,620
The name and age of a student object is updated correctly in the person database and warned Rose is

78
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,860
affected in order not to prolong the time of decision.

79
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,000
Who will finish it?

80
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,730
And we will continue the content in the next session.

81
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,450
Goodbye.
