00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:20,150
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,900
relational model and indecision.

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,030
We want to talk about the others database concept.

4
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:39,330
Crud operations in school database as we know that we can use my school to use this to alter query language

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,380
to restore the data in the form of relational database management system.

6
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:52,630
This cure is the most popular language for adding, accessing and managing content in a database.

7
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,850
It is most known for its quick processing problem.

8
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,620
Reliability eases and flexibility of use.

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,480
The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce and lightning

10
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,290
applications.

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,320
The most common use for my school, however, is for the purpose of their database.

12
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:22,180
My school provides a set of some basic but most essential operations that will help you to easily interact

13
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,000
with the minuscule database, and these operations are known as crowd operations.

14
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:38,180
In this tutorial, we will implement our database based on minuscule database and explain the relationship

15
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,420
between the GO programming language and my school.

16
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,480
But you can use any database you want.

17
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,990
Query.

18
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:57,860
Equerry is a request for data results and for action and data, you can use it quickly to answer a simple

19
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,490
question.

20
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:05,960
To perform calculations, to combine data from different tables or even to add change or delete table

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,410
data.

22
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:14,060
As tables grown in size, they can have hundreds of thousands of records, which makes it impossible

23
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,760
for the user to pick out a specific records from that data with a query.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,570
You can apply a filter to the tables data so that you only get the information that you want.

25
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:34,280
Queries that you use to retrieve data from a table or to make calculations or can't select queries.

26
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,710
Queries that add, change or delete data are called action queries.

27
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,500
You can also use a query to supply data for a form or a report.

28
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:54,830
In a well-designed database, the data that you want to present by using a form or report is often located

29
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,300
in several different tables.

30
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:04,490
Then three key part of queries is that you must understand how to construct one before you can actually

31
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,090
use them.

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,280
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

33
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,270
the next session.

34
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,950
Goodbye.
