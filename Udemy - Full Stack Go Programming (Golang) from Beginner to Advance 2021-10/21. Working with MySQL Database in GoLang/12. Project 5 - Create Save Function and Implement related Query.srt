00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello and welcome to the kulang programming language course, in this case, we want to create a function

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,890
to insert a new student in student data in person database.

3
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,200
So go to the DB connection and create new fonts.

4
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,890
First, define the function, then save that accept student object as parameter.

5
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,400
And if the addition of a student to the database is done correctly, the idea of the last added the

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,340
student will be returned as return time.

7
00:00:48,820 --> 00:01:01,540
So right func save and set a student as the parameter to the model that student

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,200
and cert and 64 as return type value.

9
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:15,250
Now, Colin Connect function for initializing minus driver name and data source name.

10
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:21,580
This function returns a DB object from a school package, which gave us access to methods contained

11
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:28,870
in that package to perform crowd operations, so define a value there like DB Collins equals and calling

12
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,040
connect function.

13
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,790
We use Ether for closing the creator DB object ether.

14
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:48,190
Do you buy the clothes after creating a DB object, the inventory parameter that creates a prepared

15
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:56,920
statement for later queries or executions, multiple queries or executions may be run concurrently from

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,240
the return, the statement.

17
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:05,350
The caller must call the statements close method when the statement is no longer needed, this function

18
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,460
returned to value.

19
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:13,600
First is Santa object from a school package that is a prepared statement and the order is error.

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:25,210
So first, define two variables like save and say comma error column equals and calling pretty parameter

21
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:35,170
to prepare and write suitable query for create a new object insert

22
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,570
into the student.

23
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,800
Said variable of a student I.D. name and age

24
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,190
values.

25
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,230
Sit question mark instead of variable values.

26
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,400
We set three question mark because we have three fields

27
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,630
check every status.

28
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:29,620
Now calling execute method from a secured package and executes a prepared statement with the given arguments

29
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,400
and returns a result summarizing the effect of the statement, this method returns to values first and

30
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,700
object of result inner faith and the other is error object.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,660
So we defined two variables like resolve and row resolved comma error calling equals and calling exec

32
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:57,100
method on the same object say dark ExAC method and set.

33
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,150
A student feels as arguments instead of question marks included statements sequentially like student

34
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,530
debt, IED

35
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,080
and the student, the name

36
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,930
and the student age.

37
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,730
Check it or a status.

38
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:42,450
Now calling last inserted I from front cured package that returns the integer generated by the database

39
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:49,170
in response to a comment publicly, this will be form and alter increment column, then inserting a

40
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,680
new rule.

41
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:55,290
This function returns to values first and in CC for value, and the other is error.

42
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,610
So we write two variables like student I.D. and the rule the student's

43
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:16,660
I.D. Common error coloring equals resolved start last user I.D. and check notice the.

44
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,160
Was

45
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,900
that the rule?

46
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:37,480
Now, sit a student ideas writer and type of save function writer student Spike Lee format the cold

47
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,800
and save the project.

48
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,710
Now we could define the function name safe that accept a student object as parameter and save it as

49
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:54,640
a record into the student table in person database and returns the idea generated of the added new record

50
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,780
by database.

51
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,450
Now it's time to go to the main function to use this query statement.

52
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,710
Go to the main function and clear the last code.

53
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,920
In this case, we want to save a new student and person database, so we should use from save function

54
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:23,750
from TBE tools that accept a student as input arguments and returns, either that person like so first

55
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,060
create and a student object from a student strike and initialize it.

56
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:41,060
Define a variable like a student column equals model dot student and initialize it I.D., for example.

57
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,660
Seven.

58
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:53,780
Name, for example, Robert and Age, for example.

59
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,080
50.

60
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,560
Now, you would say function from DB tools.

61
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,870
Pichai's and St create the student object as are doing this to eat first.

62
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:14,180
Define an integer variable for return value of the function last insert i.

63
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:26,420
The column equals DB tools, dot save and post a student as arguments to it

64
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,670
and display the last insert I-T.

65
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,560
Last year there two I.D..

66
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,640
Reformat the court, save the project and execute the program go wrong.

67
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,290
It's like a slush main that's made that glue.

68
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,500
Now we can see the output, the new student is a sort quietly in student table in the person database

69
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,160
and new student ideas return.

70
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,820
We can go to my school database and see these changes.

71
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,200
First, create a new query type.

72
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:30,860
Go to the database use person and create a select query sending Mr. Brown.

73
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:41,330
The student and execute the query, we could see the newest student is a stone chronically in database

74
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,860
87 seven named Robert and age 50.

75
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:46,790
OK.

76
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,950
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish you and we will continue the content in

77
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,910
the next session.

78
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,570
Goodbye.
