00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,070
Hello and welcome to the gold and polygamy language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,480
We could define connect function to communicate to the MySchool database.

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:27,090
And in this time, we want to perform crowd operations by writing different functions.

4
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,980
First, you start by writing the queries related to the select statement, so create the function to

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,060
select all the student records and return a student at a

6
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,840
function.

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,870
Select all the students.

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:01,410
And return type is a right off model that a student modern, that student

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,320
now cutting iconic function for initializing my school driver named on datasource name.

10
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,760
This function returns a DBI object from a school package, which gives us access to the metals contained

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,220
in the package to perform craft operations.

12
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,660
So first, define a variable like DB call equals connect.

13
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,930
After creating a DB object from a school package, be invoked query method that it executes a query

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:45,360
that acts it, a school query statement as a string parameter and returns rows and road objects so defined

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,770
to variables like rows and rows and column query methods.

16
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,950
Rows and rows.

17
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,010
Column equals DB dots query.

18
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,960
In this case, we want to see all the students in student data, so we should use select queries statement.

19
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,440
So we write select query as a student parameter.

20
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,200
Double quotation mark ends, right?

21
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,790
Select a song from a student.

22
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,330
Now catch Aurora status, if at all

23
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,410
like that.

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,800
That's all.

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,740
A.

26
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:37,910
F.

27
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,910
We use the author for closing a created VB object.

28
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,850
The author DV Don Close notes.

29
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,260
We create a list of student strive to act each new, a student that is read from the database, from

30
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,970
the student state ID and at the end of fetching data from the database.

31
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:11,370
The student list is displayed by the mentors return value, so define the value of like student's column

32
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,780
he calls all day of modern

33
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,960
student

34
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:29,070
now put the return value of the query inside the full loop to access each of the rows by the next function.

35
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,900
So we write four rows dots next.

36
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,560
Next, function prepares the next result role for Reading with the scan method.

37
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:55,060
It returns true on success or false if there is no next resolve, and that all happened while preparing

38
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,720
it, so we create an object from a student instruction.

39
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,020
Student calling equals modern art student.

40
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:19,650
And calling it skin metal on Rose Resort to read records, one by one is scanned copies the colors in

41
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,940
the current roll into the values pointed at by destination.

42
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,840
The number of values in destination must be the same as the number of the columns in rows defiant or

43
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,750
variable and invoke a scan function at all.

44
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,120
He calls Rose the scanner set a student I.D. as pointer.

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:59,790
Student I.D. So the student name the student's name and sits a student page.

46
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,970
Eskom, Converse, Collins read from the database into the following common go times and special time

47
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,440
provided by the issuer package, so check every status.

48
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,000
And continue.

49
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:49,640
Now at each read that record that contains a student of the least of his students by the app and function,

50
00:05:49,970 --> 00:06:03,120
the app built in function Athens elements to the end of its life, the students he calls upon in the

51
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,480
students, the student.

52
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:16,750
Now, return as student lease has returned values of function due to its students.

53
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,100
Now we could define the function name, select all as students that fit all students of a student table

54
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,980
in person database by the select the statement.

55
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,830
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

56
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,760
the next session.

57
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,510
Goodbye.
