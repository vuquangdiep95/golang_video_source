00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,190
Hello and welcome to the golden and programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,960
We talked about insert into and select queries and indecision.

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,420
We want to talk about the other queries.

4
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:39,970
Updates recourse, this fuel update query is used to modify the existing records in a table, you can

5
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:46,630
use the very close with the update query to update the selected rules, otherwise all the rows would

6
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,440
be affected.

7
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,150
Now you can see the syntax for execute this query.

8
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,480
Go to MySchool database to create a new query.

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:04,540
We want to update data record of student table values in person database so before write the new query

10
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:13,570
select database by the comment use database name so right use person semicolon.

11
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,040
Go to the next line.

12
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,730
In this case, we want to change the value of the name and age fields in the record.

13
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,700
Whose idea values is equal to one?

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,070
So first, select a student table and see a student's information whose its ID is one.

15
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:42,250
Select a star from the student semicolon and execute the query.

16
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,290
Now we can see the student table for the IED number.

17
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,430
Vaughn name is change and age is twenty five.

18
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:59,350
And we want to change these values for name to Edward and for the age is 14.

19
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,170
So clear.

20
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,870
Select Query and write our query for Update.

21
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,550
Update.

22
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,450
Student.

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:23,130
Said, write the names of the fields whose values we want to change and mention the new value of each

24
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,590
one in front of the name of each bill like name equals

25
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,160
at what?

26
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,770
Coma and age equals 40.

27
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,580
And now, right condition or otherwise, there are records whose values are to be changed.

28
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,820
So be right there.

29
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,530
I.D. equals one semicolon now execute the query.

30
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:14,270
And again, select on this student table, select a star from a student and execute the query again.

31
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,440
Now we can see the values of name and age of the record whose idea values is equal to one has changed

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,640
the name.

33
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,990
Edwardian age is 14.

34
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,030
Now go to a site and continue.

35
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:41,610
Delayed Operation Discuter Delayed Quarry is used to delete the existing records from a cave.

36
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,250
You can use the word close with an idyllic query to delete the selected rules.

37
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,640
Otherwise, all the records would be deleted.

38
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,830
You can see the syntax now.

39
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,190
Go to my school database to create a new query.

40
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:11,550
First, clear, the last query, we to delete a record of a and table values in person database.

41
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:23,610
So before writing new query select database by the common use database name used person, in this case,

42
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,050
we want to delete the record whose idea value is equal to one.

43
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:39,510
So we try delete from a student and now write condition or otherwise.

44
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:50,910
The records whose idea value is wrong and is to be removed from the student tated where I.D. equals

45
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,070
one and set semicolon now execute the query.

46
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:09,140
Now, clear the delete query and write the Senate query for display the changes, select a star from

47
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,820
the student and search semicolon, execute the query.

48
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,910
Now we can see the record whose idea value is equal to one has removed from a student today.

49
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:31,730
So far, we have been able to perform crud operations inside the MySQL database in future sessions.

50
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:39,380
We will examine the relationship between the GO programming language and the MySchool database in order

51
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,270
not to prolong the time of decision.

52
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,590
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

53
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,340
Goodbye.
