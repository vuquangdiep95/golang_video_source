00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,140
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,780
We want to create another select function.

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:28,580
We want to fetch a student by a connection, otherwise we create a query by workless for these Sampat.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,790
We want to define the function that returns a student base I.D. number.

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,480
So first, define the function name.

6
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:45,730
Select a student based I.D. that exit an integer parameter as I.D number and return a student based

7
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,570
that idea.

8
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,370
Not so first.

9
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,140
Go to DB connection and create our function.

10
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:03,670
Find Select a student base I.D..

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,480
And set a variable like IED as input parameter by the type of end

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,560
and defined a student as return type model.

13
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,500
The student

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,500
now cutting connect function for initializing my school driver name and data source name.

15
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,080
This function returns a DV object from a school package, which gives us access to the metals contained

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,080
in that package to perform cloud operations.

17
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,630
So define a variable like DV call equals and calling connect function

18
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,420
after creating a DV object from a school package.

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:01,640
The invoked Queretaro method that it executes a query that is expected to return at most one rule quit

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,770
enrollment or office returns and none nil.

21
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,490
Value and awards are deferred until rose is scanned.

22
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,400
Method is called.

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,660
If the query select no roads, the roads are scanned.

24
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,340
Her return error no rules.

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,820
Otherwise, the roads.

26
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,740
The scan is Cairns, the first selected row and this cost the rest.

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,470
So define a variable like roll and roll method.

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,430
Roll.

29
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:35,360
Column E equaled and calling query row method from TBE Optic DB Dot Query Law.

30
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:42,740
In this case, we want to select a student in student table by based on the given either number, and

31
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,800
we should use select query parameter.

32
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,250
We are very close and so writes that a query has a string parameter.

33
00:02:50,210 --> 00:03:06,800
Select the star from the student and set very close condition based IED their IED equals instead of

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,970
the IED value put a question mark and as the second parameter, we received the IED value from inside

35
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,570
the method.

36
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,940
So we write IED.

37
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:26,220
OK, we use defer for closing the created object d4 d without clothes.

38
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,730
Now we create an object from a student, a strong student calling equals model of the student.

39
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,340
And calling Eskin Mitchell on roll resolve to lead record defying and already able and invoke, yes,

40
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,510
can't function.

41
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:11,160
They're all calling equals roll dots can sit A-student ideas pointer percent student I.D. Karma.

42
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:25,400
So the student, the undersigned student, the last name and set age and person, a student dot H.

43
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,570
S can converse.

44
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,220
Collins read from the database and to the following comment Go tights and ESPECIE.

45
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,740
All types provided by the rescue package.

46
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,020
Check in order status

47
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,920
now.

48
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,860
Return your student as return value off function.

49
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:01,460
If the student is not available, the NOL value will be returned with the select Ike Return student.

50
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,530
Now we could define a function named select students based idea that the return student of students

51
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,020
made that in-person database by the select statement based I.D. number.

52
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,070
Now we go to the main function to use this query statement.

53
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,030
First, clear the last code.

54
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:34,390
In this case, we want to select a student base I.D. number, so we should use from select a student

55
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,970
based I.D. function from DV tools that accept their student ideas input arguments.

56
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,400
So first, define a variable like a student calling equals and calling selected student based I.D. function

57
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,710
from DB tools.

58
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:01,630
For example, you set I.D. number three, go to the next line and the displayed is student variables.

59
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:02,800
If P

60
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,450
I.D. caller

61
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,870
student

62
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,730
I.D..

63
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,510
Backsplash and

64
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,020
name calling.

65
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,010
Student that name.

66
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,370
And I kiss slash and.

67
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:48,960
Age column, student, the age reform, reforming the code and save the project and go to execute the

68
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:57,300
program, go Ronald Reagan, slash Maine, Maine Dot Go.

69
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,930
Now we can see the output.

70
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,710
And it is expected that the information about a student whose I.D. number is three will be returned.

71
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:17,180
Now we could select a student based I.D. number from person database and display it in order not to

72
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,620
prolong the time of decision.

73
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,460
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

74
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,240
Goodbye.
