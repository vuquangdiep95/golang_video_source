00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,130
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course in the peregrine's session, we talked about

2
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,830
crowd operations, and in this session we want to talk about the others database concept.

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:40,480
E.R. Diagrams, E.R. Diagram is a visual representation of data that describes how data is related to

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,110
each other.

5
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:50,910
In E.R. model, we disintegrate data into entities, attributes and set up relationships between entities.

6
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:59,190
All this can be represented visually using the inner diagram, for example, in the below diagram.

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,230
Anyone can see and understand what the dark wrong wants to convey.

8
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,840
Developer develops that sign, whereas a visitor visits a website.

9
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:23,800
Components of air diagram, entity attributes, relationships and etc. form the components of E.R. diagram,

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,020
and there are defined symbols and shapes to represent each one of their.

11
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,880
Let's see how we can represent these in our yard diagram.

12
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:46,390
Entity Database Entity is a team, person, place, unit object or any item about which the data should

13
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,910
be captured and this stored in the form of properties, workflow and tables.

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,200
Simple, rectangular blocks represent an entity.

15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:10,480
Relationships between entities weak and a strong home boss is used to set up relationships between two

16
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,980
or more entities.

17
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,470
Attributes for any entity.

18
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,630
Ellipse is used to represent attributes of any entity.

19
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,940
It is connected to the entity.

20
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,930
Which entity?

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,360
A weak entity is represented using double rectangular boxes.

22
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,930
It is generally connected to another entity.

23
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Key attributes for any entity to represent a key attribute, the attribute name inside the ellipse is

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,940
underlined.

25
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:05,620
Derived attributes for any entity, the right attributes are those which are derived based on other

26
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,340
attributes.

27
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,420
For example, age can be derived from date of birth to represent a drive attribute.

28
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:21,580
Another dot ellipse is created inside the main ellipse multi value attribute for any entity.

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,110
Double ellipse.

30
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,630
One inside another represent the attribute, which can have multiple values.

31
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:41,180
Composite attribute for any entity, a composite attribute is the attribute, which also has attributes

32
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:50,150
you will see the address composite attribute, which contains other attributes like country, city estate

33
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,380
and a suite.

34
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:04,860
E.R., Model two relational model, as we all know, that E.R. model can be represented using E.R. diagrams,

35
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:11,920
which is a great way of designing and representing the database design in more of a flowchart form.

36
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,610
It is very convenient to design the database using the E.R. model by creating an E.R. diagram and literally

37
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,140
converting it into relational modern to design your table.

38
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:32,160
Not all the E.R. model constrains in components can be directly transformed into relational model,

39
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,640
but an approximate schema can be right.

40
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:43,800
So let's take a few examples of your diagrams and convert it into relational model schema, hence creating

41
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,660
tables in our DMs.

42
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,480
Entity becomes table.

43
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:59,000
Entity in your model is changed into tables, or we can say for every entity in our model, a table

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,840
is created in relational model and attributes of the entity gift converted to columns of the table,

45
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,650
and the primary key is specify for entity in the E.R. model will become the primary key for the table

46
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,240
in relational model.

47
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,190
Entity relationship model.

48
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:29,440
In this database, model, relationships are created by dividing object of interest into entity and

49
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,290
its characteristics into attributes.

50
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,590
Different entities are related using relationships.

51
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,520
E.R. models are designed to represent the relationships and to picture real form to make it easier for

52
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,540
different stakeholders to understand, this model is good to design the database, which can then be

53
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,360
turned into tables in relational model.

54
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:03,220
Let's take an example If we have to design a person database, the student will be an entity with attributes

55
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:10,510
i.e. the name, age and address as address is generally complex.

56
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:16,810
It can be another entity Venus Williams Street Name, PIN Code, S.T.A.R., cetera, and there will

57
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,910
be a relationship between then.

58
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,610
Relational model.

59
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:34,040
In this model, data is organized in two dimensional tables, and the relationship is maintained by

60
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,600
is touring a common field.

61
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:45,620
This model was introduced by EAF called in 1970, and since then it has been the most widely used database

62
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,010
model.

63
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
In fact, we can say the only database model used around the world.

64
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,120
The basic structure of data in the relational is table.

65
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,190
All the information related to a particular type is stored in rows of that table.

66
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:06,800
Hence, tables are often known as relations in relational model.

67
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:15,170
In the coming tutorials, we will learn how to design tables in order not to prolong the time of decision.

68
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,520
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

69
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,270
Goodbye.
