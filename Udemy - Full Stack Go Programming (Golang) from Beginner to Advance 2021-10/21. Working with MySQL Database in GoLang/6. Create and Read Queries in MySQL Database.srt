00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,410
Hello and welcome to the blank and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,420
creating a database and table queries and indecision.

3
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,820
We want to talk about the other queries.

4
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:43,450
Insert into a statement this you'll insert into a statement is used to add new rolls of data to a table

5
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,470
in the database.

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,180
It is possible to write the insert into a statement in two ways.

7
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,350
First is specify both the column names and the values to be inserted.

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,190
Now you can see the syntax.

9
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:13,990
And second, if you are adding value for all the colours of the table, you do not need to specify the

10
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,940
column names in this query.

11
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:24,400
However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table here.

12
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,070
The inserted into syntax would be as follows.

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,400
Now go to my school database to create a new query.

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,290
We want to insert values into a student table in person database so people write a new query select

15
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,790
database by the comment and use database name.

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,750
So we write query statement use person.

17
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,600
Go to the next line.

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,350
First, we create a query for insert values in a stool and table by select some fields of the student

19
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,760
tail.

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,110
So the right answer into the student

21
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:22,700
in parentheses, we said fields that we want insert values to them like name and age, name, comma,

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:36,290
age, clause Frances's and then values open and close branches again and set values for those fields,

23
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,150
for example,

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,250
chain for name and 24 for each.

25
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:57,460
And said, semicolon in the end of this statement, now execute the query in the navigation panel,

26
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,590
right click and select Refresh.

27
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:08,280
Then we select Person Database and go to Table submenu and right click on this student did and select

28
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,490
the roles limit.

29
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:21,020
OK, now you can see the new record added to the student table because you insert values for name and

30
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,980
age fields.

31
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:28,670
Now we clear the last query and create a new query for insert values for all fields.

32
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,000
So we write insert into the student values

33
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:57,900
and set values for all fields, respectively, for example, two for I.D. and Sit Robert for name and

34
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:08,970
security as h and execute again a statement go to the Navigator panel, right click and reference wrong

35
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:15,360
and go to the database person and on the student table, right click and select rules.

36
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,850
Now you can see the new record added to this student data.

37
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,120
In this case, we saw twist or two different values in two different ways.

38
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,620
Inside this student tale, it now goes twist, lies and continue.

39
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:44,610
Read Operation Statement this Q and select a statement is used to fetch the data from a database table,

40
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,810
which returns these data in the form of a result table.

41
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,410
This result tables are called results sets.

42
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:59,340
If you want to fit some of the fields variable in the table, then you can use the following syntax

43
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:00,990
here.

44
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,290
Column one comma column two are the fields of a table whose values you want to fetch.

45
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,220
If you want to fit all the feeds available in the table, then you can use the following syntax.

46
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,000
Now go to my school database to create a new query.

47
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,820
First, clear the last query.

48
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,940
We want to select values from a student table in person database.

49
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,060
So before right and you query select database by the comment use database name.

50
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:44,890
So write query statement, use person cynical and go to the next line.

51
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,240
We want to create the select query in two ways.

52
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:58,850
First, select query for some fields of a student table, so we write select right field names that

53
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:10,660
we want to display like i.e. the common name and continue to query from the student, said Semicolon,

54
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,850
and execute the statement.

55
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,880
Now we can see a student table records were displayed based on the selected fields, I.D. and name.

56
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,640
It's time to create a new query and display on fields of the student table.

57
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,860
So clear the last go

58
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,940
and write select put an asterisk.

59
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:45,760
The asterisk indicates that all fields in the table should be selected as tar or asterisk from the student's.

60
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,350
Sit semicolon and again, execute the query.

61
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,800
Now we can see a student table records were displayed based on all fields.

62
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,550
OK.

63
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,350
In order not to prolong the time of decision.

64
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,490
Will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

65
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,300
Goodbye.
