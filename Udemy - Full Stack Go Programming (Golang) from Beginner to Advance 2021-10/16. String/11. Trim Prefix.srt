00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,690
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,500
suffix, and in this session we want to talk about the other strings concept.

3
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,850
Three Perfect's.

4
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,990
This method is used to train the leading perfect system from the given string.

5
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,160
If the given string does not contain the specified perfect string, then dysfunctional returns the original

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,140
string without any change.

7
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,830
Now you can see the syntax.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:59,550
Here, SDR represent the original estrange and prefix SDR represent the prefix string.

9
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,090
Now let's go to the school program to illustrate how to trim the prefix the string from the given.

10
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:16,310
This string first creating an initializing to a string using shorthand declaration is the wrong call.

11
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:25,490
It equals welcome to school programming language.

12
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,690
SDR to call and equals.

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,560
This is the tutorial.

14
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,410
Go blank.

15
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,820
Okay, before training.

16
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,700
First, we displayed these two variables.

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,590
If they sit in the Sage Strings D for training

18
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,550
and display these two variables, if he is still learning

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,600
and if he is still to.

20
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:16,040
Now training perfect this from the given as strings using clearly fixed function.

21
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,380
So define another variable like result.

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,390
One call equals film the strings package invoked treme. perfect function.

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,590
Three.

24
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,250
Prefix function first sit.

25
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:45,310
Estrange the one and said prefix value for the example in this case, then come to.

26
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:58,220
And define another area to result to calling equals the strings package called three Perfect's

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:09,500
sit name of variable or two and say for office, for example, language in this case.

28
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,710
Now we display the results after three imperfect systems value.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,670
Copy these two lines and paste here and change these value gesture one to resolved for.

30
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,450
And this year, to resolve to

31
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,100
reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

32
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:50,200
Now we can see the output extremes after trimming go programming language and for very evil to is.

33
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,990
This is the tutorial of goal.

34
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:58,280
We were able to modify our desired strings through the tree into a fixed function, using the tree into

35
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,180
a fixed function.

36
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,170
We were able to separate the value of the welcome too, from first of the very bad and return your rest

37
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,950
to the value of it.

38
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:13,580
And in the second variable, because the desired variable for the train perfect was not present within

39
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,540
the desired history.

40
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,790
The original string was returned in order not to prolong the time of decision.

41
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,750
We will finish sheet and we will continue the content in the next session.

42
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,530
Goodbye.
