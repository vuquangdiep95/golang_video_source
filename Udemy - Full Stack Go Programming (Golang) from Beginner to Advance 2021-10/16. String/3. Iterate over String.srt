00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,230
Hello and welcome to the goal and putting it on language course in the previous session, we talked

2
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,570
about that the strings are immutable.

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,250
And in this session, we want to talk about the other this strings concept.

4
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,860
Iterate over a string.

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:41,530
You can iterate over history using full range loop, this loop can iterate over the Unicode code point

6
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,430
for a string.

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,630
Now you can see the scene techs here.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,250
The index is the variable, which is saw the first bite of UTF eight encoded could point and see it's

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,190
AH is toward the characters of the given string and SDR is a string.

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,180
Now let's go to this school program to illustrate how to iterate over a string.

11
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,630
First, define a string variable and initialize it for the example in.

12
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:35,840
Value calling equals go programming language now create a range in the fall for ETRADE characters of

13
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:47,180
value string for index see edge calling equals range.

14
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,200
Value.

15
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,800
And in this case, the bone to display index number and index value of each character of value a string.

16
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:21,470
So if if the value of index per cent, the conversion characters set for index number, ease and conversion

17
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,650
character for characters is c a person C lowercase.

18
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:42,920
So set it for character batches, list and set index and see it's re reformat the called Save the Project

19
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,990
and execute the program.

20
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,030
Now we can see the output results to print all the characters of the.

21
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,750
These are listing separately with its index number.

22
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,580
For the example, value of index zero is G approaches.

23
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:09,080
Value of index one is all lowercase and value of Index 20 is a large piece.

24
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:15,830
In order not to prolong the time on decision, you will finish it and we will continue the content in

25
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,850
the next session.

26
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,390
Goodbye.
