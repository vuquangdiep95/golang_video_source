00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,930
Hello and welcome to the Golden Age programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:26,770
We talked about arena space industry, and in this session, we want to talk about the other strengths

3
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,430
concept.

4
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,740
Train service.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,990
This method is used to train the trailing extreme from beginning this week, if the given string does

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,470
not contain the specified suffix string, then dysfunctional returns the original string without any

7
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,040
changes.

8
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,220
Now you can see the syntax.

9
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:00,090
Here, SDR represent the original history and self-esteem, represent the suffix string.

10
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,280
Now let's go to a school program to illustrate how to train a suffix estranged from the given the string.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:20,690
First, creating and initializing to or and using shorthand declaration, define a variable like SC

12
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:38,600
or Van Hollen equals welcome to go through ground language and define another body to like SDR to and

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:50,720
assign value to eat like theses that trillion of go length

14
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:02,870
before trimming the now displayed these two varieties first into message if the first strings before

15
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,660
trimming and display these two varieties, FP is still wrong.

16
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,290
And if the Your True

17
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:31,340
OK Now training pair fix this string from the given string using 3nd suffix function first define variable

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,980
like result one calling equals from the strings package

19
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:52,520
call 3mm suffix function treen suffix function first name of variable is stillborn and another argument

20
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,840
is suffix.

21
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:01,490
For the example, in this case, we set programming language

22
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,960
OK and define another variable life result to call in equals.

23
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,580
The Strings Package The string suffix function

24
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,770
sets name of value list or two and sets suffixes.

25
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,600
String line for this case.

26
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,010
Hell.

27
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,180
OK, now given to displaying this result after trimming suffix string values.

28
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,490
So copy these three lines and paste here.

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:53,600
Change these values after and variables is still going to result from this year to to the result to

30
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,620
the format.

31
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,860
The call save the project and execute the program.

32
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,680
Now we can see the output we were able to modify, our guys are sitting through the trim subpixel space

33
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,550
function for SDR one after trimming.

34
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:19,770
We have welcome to go and for SDR to very good after trimming we have this is the tutorial of go using

35
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,300
the trim suffix function.

36
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:28,020
We were able to separate the value of the programming language from and off the variable volume and

37
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,780
return the rest to the value.

38
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:36,240
And in the second variable, because the desired value of the trim suffix was not present a desire desired

39
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,660
swing.

40
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,420
The original string was returned in order not to prolong the time of decision.

41
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,710
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

42
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,400
Goodbye.
