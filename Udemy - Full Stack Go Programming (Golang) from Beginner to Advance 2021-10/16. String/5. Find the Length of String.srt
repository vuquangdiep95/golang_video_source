00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:19,810
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,350
access to individual by of the ice rink.

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,860
And in this session, we want to talk about the other extreme concept.

4
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,090
Find the length of the Earth shrink.

5
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,650
In Go Link, you can find the length of the string using two functions.

6
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,190
One is lamb and another is wrong.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,280
Count in this from using lean function.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,450
It returns the number of bytes of this range using room count in a string function.

9
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,470
It returns the total number of drone presents in this room.

10
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,040
Now let's go to this school with program to illustrate how to find the length of this string.

11
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,000
First, creating an initializing astronaut using shorthand declaration.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:22,400
So define a variable like SDR column equals and said this string value welcome.

13
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:40,930
To go programming language display this year, the FP is strange value and so valuable off.

14
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,950
Now finding the length of the ice rink using limb function.

15
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:59,470
So define a variable like the lengths one column he calls and call LEN function and sit is your variable

16
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,760
as argument.

17
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:18,920
Now, displaying the length of this range, if he lands flown by land function in and said lands long

18
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,570
here.

19
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:29,330
And in another case, we want to find the length of the string using room count in a string function.

20
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:37,820
So define another variable like lengths to call in equals wrong counting.

21
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:50,660
The string is in Typekit UTF eight, so invoke UTF eight UTF eight dot long count in this string and

22
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,260
set.

23
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,510
It's your variable as argument.

24
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:05,900
So go to the next line and display the length of IS three in the end, if he links to Y.

25
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:17,780
Jerome Count in a strange function column and set it in links to

26
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,040
reform at the courts, save the project and execute the program.

27
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:35,720
Now we can see the output length swung by land function history for and links to by wrong counting.

28
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,210
The string function is three four.

29
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:45,380
You could find links of string variable by two ways first, by laying function and the other by wrong

30
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,240
count in a string function in order not to prolong the time of decision.

31
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,560
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

32
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,490
Goodbye.
