00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:19,440
Hello and welcome to the gold and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,800
a split after mystery, and in this session we want to talk about the others eastern concept.

3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,010
Spirit after in.

4
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:39,830
This function, ESPN+ stream into our service streams after each instance of the given separator and

5
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,310
returns a slice which contains these services.

6
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,430
Now you can see the scene techs.

7
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:57,150
Here, SDR is the string sit is the separator and and is used to find the number of solid strings to

8
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,060
return if angry turned down zero.

9
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:06,360
Then it returns atoms in solid strings and the last string service strings will not be.

10
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,100
If an equal to zero, then it will return Neal.

11
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,620
And if in less than zero, then it will return on solid strings.

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:24,360
Now let's go to the school with Cary Grant to illustrate how to split after in a string.

13
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:35,470
First, creating and initializing the three Issing variables of us, Esperon calling equals CET value.

14
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,720
Welcome.

15
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:45,280
Come on the Karma Go programming

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,550
language, go to next line.

17
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,060
Define another variable like SDR to column equals.

18
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,830
My name is rather.

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:16,940
And defined territory you are tree pollen equals set value for the example I am to go poor grammar now

20
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,520
dispelling a string variable before using a split after end function.

21
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:34,460
AFP STR Home is still a long and free PCR tool.

22
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,190
Just, you know, two and display 30.

23
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,620
It is still a tree is still empty.

24
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,710
Now is fleeting.

25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,040
The given string using is split after and function.

26
00:02:52,790 --> 00:03:00,590
For the example, it splits first string into all substring separated by the comma separator and returns

27
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,230
a slice which contains solid string.

28
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,760
Go to the next line.

29
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,160
Define a variable like resolved.

30
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:18,140
One calling equals the strings package that is split after end function.

31
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:29,960
First set variable like is still warm and set comma separate war and for third argument, assign count

32
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,620
value that determines the number of solid things to return.

33
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:41,000
For the example, we set three and define another variable life result.

34
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:54,100
Two column equals strings that string at the end, said variable estimate tool and set a space as separator

35
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,310
and sit for number of solid string and go to the next line and define another variable.

36
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:09,590
Like these are three Cullin equals package strings that select a split after end function.

37
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:19,460
Set variable is still tree and set exclamation mark as separator and set one as number of solid string

38
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,520
now displaying the result.

39
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,430
But it is for the example for the result one be display value on type of variable.

40
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:44,300
So right, if that is less and resolved, one type column per cent T upper case by case less T result

41
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:58,260
one column first and the back is less in search result one comma resolved one.

42
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,020
Now iterate result one.

43
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,370
String a slice and display value of it by the range for a loop.

44
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,690
Go to the next line and define it for loop.

45
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,170
For the score come out.

46
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:22,070
Already, the lowest value column equals range in result vanderslice a strange go through the body statement

47
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,960
and p the value

48
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,580
go out of the for loop range and display the other variables.

49
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:48,440
FP but I just and result to call insert value the result two and result three column and display resolve

50
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,660
three.

51
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,970
Reformat the court, save the project and execute the program.

52
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:05,870
Now we can see the output for the first variable defined the Como character as a separator and city

53
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:13,310
value as number of substring to use the split function and drop a slice of the string as a return value

54
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,880
inside the resultant body, even then display the value and the type of the result variable and use

55
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,460
the range for loop to iterate.

56
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,870
The result is nice value and the result one value even consists of three parts.

57
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,720
The answer to this for the second and third levels in third variable.

58
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,590
It does not contain the given separately.

59
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:43,760
Then it will return a slice of length, one which contain only its variable value in order not to prolong

60
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,980
the time of decision to be finished, and we will continue to contend in the next session.

61
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,700
Goodbye.
