00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,500
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:24,100
In the previous session, we talked about three imperfect in history and in this, we want to talk about

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,840
the other extreme concept.

4
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,510
Is split a string in go blank?

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,240
In GO districts, you are allowed to split a string into a slice with the help of following functions.

6
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,830
These functions are defined under a strings package, so you have to import the strings package in your

7
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,290
program for accessing these functions.

8
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,630
First, this split.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,560
This function splits a string into all solid string separated by the Gibbons separator and returns a

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,320
slice which contains these substances.

11
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,380
Now you can see the scene techs.

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,620
Here, SDR is the extreme and SAP is the separator.

13
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:24,320
If SDR does not contain the given sit and sip is not empty, then it will return a slice of black swan,

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:33,770
which contain only SDR or if the SAP is A. Then it will split after each UTF eight sequence, or if

15
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,620
both SDR and SIP are empty, then it will return an entire slice.

16
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,470
Now let's go to the school for a grant to illustrate how to split a string.

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,240
First, creating an initializing the three extreme variables is still wrong.

18
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,530
Calling equals CET value very calm.

19
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:17,850
Comma to the comma, go programming, comma language, go to the next line and define another variable

20
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,030
like SDR to call an equal set value.

21
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:35,940
My name is Robert and go to the next line is two or three equals cet value.

22
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,330
I am.

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,280
A GO program is

24
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,930
now displaying Valley three is before using a split function.

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,140
AFP S.T.A.R. colour is still warm.

26
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,080
If this is your tool, colour sit still too.

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,700
And if P is to your tree colour and asset value, there is still a tree.

28
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,510
Okay, now is pleading to give you this string using split function.

29
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,090
For the example, S2 is first is turning into all substring separated by the comma separator and returns

30
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,710
this guide.

31
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:36,720
It contains some strings defining variable light result while calling equals the strings package and

32
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:49,680
call split function first set variable name in this case SDR one and set separator in this case, comma

33
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,540
for the other variables.

34
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,370
Do these resolved?

35
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,760
Oh, Colin decodes the strings package that is fleet.

36
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:13,260
And that SDR to variable and set a space for this case, go to the next line and define another variable

37
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,510
result.

38
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:29,330
Three Colin equals strength the split function there are three and for this case, said exclamation

39
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:37,090
mark as the creator now displaying the result variables for the example, for the resolved one, peacefully

40
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,420
value and type of value will go to the next line.

41
00:04:42,380 --> 00:05:04,010
If Earth back has less and resolved one time per cent to offer case back T please on one per cent,

42
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:13,460
the bank is less and said resolved long and resolved one.

43
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:22,130
Now its rate result one is a slice and disbelief value of it by the range for a loop.

44
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:36,260
For the example, four underscore common set of areas ED like value column equals wrench in result won't

45
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:43,100
go to the body a statement and said if the value.

46
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:57,160
And go out of the follow up and display the other variables, for the example, FP result to color resolved

47
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,190
to be resolved.

48
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,260
Three, Colin and said result.

49
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,470
Three.

50
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,830
OK.

51
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,900
Defoliant, they quote, save the project and execute the program.

52
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:25,340
Now we can see that output for the first variable defined the common character as a separate or to use

53
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:32,260
the split function and drop is a slice of the string as the return value inside the reasons why and

54
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,260
then display the value and type of the result variable and use the range POLU to iterate.

55
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,030
The result is a nice value.

56
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,470
We also do this for the second and third variables in third variables.

57
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,960
It does not contain the given separator.

58
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:55,220
Then it returns lines of legs, one which contain only CIF variable value.

59
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,830
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish sheet and we will continue the content

60
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,030
in the next session.

61
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,780
Goodbye.
