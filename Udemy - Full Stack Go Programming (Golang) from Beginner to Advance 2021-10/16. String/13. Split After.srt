00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,140
Hello and welcome to the gold and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,990
split this string, and in this session we want to talk about the other extreme concept.

3
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,720
Split after.

4
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:41,670
Dysfunction split S3 into all saw the strings after each instance of the given separator and returns

5
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,850
a slice which contains these services.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,110
Now you can see the syntax here.

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,650
SDR is the string and set is the separator.

8
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:01,710
If SDR does not contain the given, set and set is not empty, then it will return a slice of length,

9
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:11,160
one which contain only SDR or if the sip is A. Then it will split after each UTF eight sequence or if

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,770
both SDR and SIP are empty, then it in return an entire slice.

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,130
Let's go to Waskow program to illustrate how to split after a string.

12
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:37,480
First, creating an initializing three speed variables defined as zero crawling equals their car comma

13
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,160
to the comma go.

14
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,280
Programming

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:56,080
common language go to next line and define another variable like SDR to call and you call.

16
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:10,090
My name is Robert and go to the next line and define another variable like SDR three calling calls and

17
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,830
set value.

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,340
I am a go programmer.

19
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,780
Now this spelling is very obvious before using ESP adaptive function.

20
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:37,480
F t SDR one column is still one, and this TR two column said that a utility or two and in the next

21
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,880
line FP is your tree call and said Why you lost your tree.

22
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:53,720
OK, now is pleading the given string using split after function, for example, splits first into all,

23
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,540
substituting separated by the comma and returns a slice which contains some strings.

24
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,580
Go to the next line.

25
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,010
Define a variable like resolved.

26
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:12,560
One column equals the strings by cage and involve a split after function.

27
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,540
First, sit ready to test your lawn and set separate or, in this case, be set.

28
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,700
Go to the next line and define another variable life result to column equals

29
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,200
heartstrings that is split after sit variable.

30
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:48,050
The city are to set a space as separate and define another variable result three column equals the string

31
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:58,520
start is split after sit variable as two or three and sit exclamation mark as separate now displaying

32
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,190
the result values for the example.

33
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,620
For the result wrong, we display value and type of variable.

34
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:19,130
So right, if Earth back is less and result one tie color first and key opportunities as Congress and

35
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:31,670
character for type variable and fetches less T and result one color first and B and set variable result

36
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,110
one and result for now.

37
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:42,010
Each rate result one extraneous lines and display value of each by the range for you.

38
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:54,380
So define both look for either a score comma defined variable like value column equals range end result,

39
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,380
one slice go to of statements and print the value.

40
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:17,210
Now displaying the other variables go out of the loop and FP result to color search result to variable

41
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,800
and in the next line.

42
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:29,210
If P result three column and said variable result three the format, they could save the project and

43
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,740
execute that program.

44
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:42,420
Now we can see the output for the first variable defined the common character as a separate or to use

45
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,530
the split after function and drop is a slice of the string as the return value inside the result.

46
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:57,400
But even and the separator itself is calculated as part of the separated string, then display the value

47
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,680
on time of the resolved one very bit and use the range for Lou to iterate the result on a slice value.

48
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,870
The answer to this for the second and third variables in third variables.

49
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,690
It does not contain the given separator.

50
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:21,180
Then it will return a slice of links long each contain only itself body value in order not to prolong

51
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,460
the time of decision even finished, and we will continue the content in the next session.

52
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,240
Goodbye.
