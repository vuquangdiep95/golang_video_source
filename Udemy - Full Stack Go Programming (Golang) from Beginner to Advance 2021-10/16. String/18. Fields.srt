00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,160
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,120
In the previous session, we talked about contains function in history, and in this session we want

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,880
to talk about the others extreme concept.

4
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,570
Go Langfield, sponsor.

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:42,820
The fields function breaks a string around each instance of one or more executed whitespace characters

6
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,900
into an array.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,040
Now you can see the scene techs.

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,130
Let's go to the school program to illustrate how to use fields function strings.

9
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:01,750
First, create a string variable and initialize it by a sentence for the example.

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:19,150
Define your variable like Mrs. Carlin equals and set a string value like welcome to go programming language.

11
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,630
Now we want to use brownfields function that get the message barrier, but as arguments and a return

12
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,010
is string alley.

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,230
So define a variable like message array.

14
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:50,630
Cullen equals said string spec package and invoke fields function and sit sage as argument.

15
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:02,890
Now this really is history at a bowling arranged for a loop for the example, for under a school comma

16
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,710
value colony equals ranch.

17
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,520
He misses very.

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:24,000
And embody a statement of the follow the display, the value of each elements of at a by FP value reform

19
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,710
at the core of the project and execute the program.

20
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:38,160
Now we can see the output we used from field function and could break a string to each instance of one

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,750
or more security by the space character in order not to prolong the time of decision to be finished,

22
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,600
and we will continue the content in the next session.

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,470
Goodbye.
