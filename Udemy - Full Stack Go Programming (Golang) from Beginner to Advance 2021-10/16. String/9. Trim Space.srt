00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,160
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,700
In the previous session, we talked about AM right this week and in this session, we want to talk about

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,260
the other restraints concept.

4
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,340
Trim is space.

5
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:40,630
This function is used to train all the leading and trailing why the space from this specify this drink.

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,020
Now you can see the scene techs.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,090
Let's go to this school program to illustrate how to train ride to space from this drink.

8
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,090
First, creating an initializing to a string using shorthand declaration, now declaring a string and

9
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,400
assign value to it, and we put some wider space at the beginning and end of this string values define

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,490
the history like it's a long column.

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,020
You could put some whitespace asterisk.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,860
And welcome to go programming

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:36,120
language, asterisk and some whitespace and declare another string and assign value to it.

14
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,750
That value of this string is sought as and which to assign some different history or to very little

15
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,220
call and equals some future faces I'd sign.

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,270
I'd say this is the uh, who like.

17
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,090
That sign outside some healthy spaces before training.

18
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,580
We now display these two variables.

19
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:16,090
If the first printed message is three weeks before training.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:30,270
And believed these two variables, FP, they're still warm, it's still warm, and if the still are

21
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,670
to call in and said it's still too late.

22
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,880
OK, now streaming via this space from the given strength using three Nastase function.

23
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:54,280
Defining a variable like result, one column equals a strength package and call Trina space function

24
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,010
three.

25
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,630
Space function and synonym name of a string.

26
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,370
The star won't go to the next line defined another variable, right?

27
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:16,420
These are two crawling equals this strings package and through three space function and said SDR to

28
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,850
an argument for this function.

29
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,070
Now we want to dispelling the results after trimming a space strings value.

30
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:33,940
So copy these three lines and case in this line and change these values after.

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,890
Resolved, long,

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,980
resolved to leave, followed at the court, save the project, then execute the program.

33
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,550
Now we can see the output we were able to modify our these are listed in through the trim of space function

34
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,720
before calling the a space function that are empty spaces at the beginning and end of the string values.

35
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,160
But after calling to trim the space function, Dante's spaces at the beginning and end of the strings

36
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,420
values are deleted in order not to prolong the time a decision will finished and will continue the content

37
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,440
in the next session.

38
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,090
Goodbye.
