00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,260
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,560
In the previous session, we talked about the fine, the length of this string and indecision.

3
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,800
We want to talk about the other extreme concept.

4
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:38,560
Trim a string and go land, you can trim extreme in different ways using the following list of functions.

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,540
All these functions are defined and strings package, so you have to import systems package in your

6
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,840
program to access this function.

7
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,980
First is trim.

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,560
This function is used to train this string all the leading and training Unicode Cook Point, which are

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,690
specified in this function.

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,350
Now you can see the syntax.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,200
Here is the art represent the current history and contest, the art represents the elements which you

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,120
want to train in the given extreme.

13
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,230
Now let's go to the school, get on to illustrate how to train is ringing goal line.

14
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:36,860
Now, create an initialized to a string is in shorthand creation, first declare its string and assign

15
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,270
value to it, which includes a number of exclamation marks.

16
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,380
So define variable as TR r one calling equals.

17
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:58,010
Its claymation mark will come to go programming

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:15,440
language and watch a game and declare and other extreme and assign value to it, which contains a number

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,130
of assign and thylacine SDR to column, he calls.

20
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,850
At sign at Sign,

21
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:45,750
this is the we are of go bang and dollar sign dance before trimming the now disparities to various first

22
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:56,290
display a message AFP the streams before screen

23
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,130
and display two variables.

24
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,430
He is TR long simplicity or wrong.

25
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:18,580
And in the next line, he is still your tool and says his skill to value right

26
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,750
now training they give in strings using three functions.

27
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:33,430
First, defining variable life result from column he calls his strings package.

28
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:43,030
Three things don't screen first name of a string.

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:51,430
In this case, these lists are long and set the string to be trained from the current string.

30
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,830
For the example, here is exclamation marks.

31
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,430
OK?

32
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:04,210
The tree method removes the exclamation marks where it appears inside the string value and do these

33
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,530
four second variable.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Define another variable like result two column equals call the by cage dot invoked to function name

35
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,680
on this string is SDR tool and set there seem to be trimmed from the current Issing.

36
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:34,990
For the example, hereis, assign and thylacine at sign and the sign.

37
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:45,350
Now you want to display the result after tweaking things when you go to the next line and copy these

38
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,280
three lines.

39
00:04:48,650 --> 00:05:05,720
Paced here and extremist after training and change, valuable result, long and resolved to reformat

40
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,200
the cool, save the project and execute the program.

41
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:20,990
Now we can see the output, we were able to modify our desired string throughout the trim function and

42
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:29,030
exclamation marks, and the other sign has removed from first and end of extreme value walk in order

43
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:35,120
not to prolong the time on decision will finish it, and we will continue the content in the next session.

44
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,630
Goodbye.
