00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,740
Hello and welcome to the goal and putting it on language course in the previous session, we talked

2
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,010
about yesterday in lead roles and in this session, we want to talk about the other extreme concept.

3
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,790
As strings are immutable.

4
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:40,750
Ingo, language is strings are immutable that once is Estrin is created, the value of this string cannot

5
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,410
be changed.

6
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:49,360
Or in other words, it strings are read only if you try to change the value the compiler will through

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,960
any rule of.

8
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,570
Now, let's go to this court, bring it on to illustrate that extremes are immutable.

9
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:08,740
First, create and initialize a variable with a string using shorthand declaration for the exam to define

10
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:18,610
a variable like value calling equals shorthand declaration and set value for this value that valid prior

11
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:26,020
to the programming language.

12
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:37,270
Now displayed is variable f p value, reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

13
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,650
Now we can see the output.

14
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,800
Welcome to go programming language.

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:52,750
What we want to change one of character of value string for the example, we want to change index number

16
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,490
one to g character.

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,830
Now write

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,490
value index number one equals back text g.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:14,500
If you trying to change the value of this ring, then the compiler v2 and they're all you can see cannot

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,480
assign to value number one.

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:25,870
So we set common for this code and we cannot change a value of a string variable because it is immutable.

22
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,660
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we'll finish it and we will continue the content in the

23
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,570
next session.

24
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,160
Goodbye.
