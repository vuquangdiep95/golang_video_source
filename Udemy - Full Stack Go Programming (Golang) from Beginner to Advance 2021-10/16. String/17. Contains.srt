00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,850
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,410
In the previous session, we talked about concatenating extremes.

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,360
And in this session, we want to talk about the other Asterix concept.

4
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:41,890
Go Blank contains function, you can search a particular text or string or character within a string

5
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,900
by using contains fonts.

6
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,190
It returns output food either true or false.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,460
Now you can see the syntax.

8
00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:00,090
If Sylvester Estrin found in SS training, then it returns true.

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,040
And if soviet-style restraint is not found in a stream bin in three turns false.

10
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,080
Now, let's go to this school program to illustrate how to use contains functional strength.

11
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:25,640
For example, we want to check, is there an AUC value within the Australia extreme or not?

12
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,430
So right, FP?

13
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,120
Used a string spike and invoke contains function.

14
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,120
So for its history or for first variable, we said Australia

15
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,260
and for second string, we set a U.

16
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:48,700
S.

17
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:57,470
Doing another sandpit we want to check is there are string by operators in Germany, a string that first

18
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,250
character is staffed by operatives and our characters are lowercase.

19
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,280
So we tried FP.

20
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:17,800
Estimates Package Select contains functions and sit for first lady to Germany and for second let it

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,250
be said G-8 are by outrageous do and other Sampat and we want to check airspace.

22
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:37,930
So right, if the strings start contains airspace for first variable and space for second and as at

23
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,030
least sample, we want to check is there one a string in a two three string?

24
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:55,600
So right, if the strings start contains, for the example, one to three for First Lady Bird and for

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,160
Second Lady Bird, we said one reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

26
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,400
Now we can see the output in the first example.

27
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:19,010
The result is true because there is an AUSA value inside Australia, and in the second example, the

28
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:26,510
Germany string does not have a gear stream because all the characters in arresting are capitalized.

29
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:33,620
But the German is sitting is only its first character is arteritis, and it is case sensitive and the

30
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,850
result is false.

31
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,630
And in the third sample space, also consider as extreme and the result is true.

32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:50,960
And in the last sandpit, we see that string one is inside a string one two three and the value of trees

33
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,340
returned in order not to prolong the time of decision.

34
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,900
We will finish it and we will continue with the content in the next session.

35
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,620
Goodbye.
