00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,820
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the 30th session, we talked about turning

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,430
left to history, and in this session we want to talk about the other extreme concept.

3
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,590
3M writes.

4
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:38,450
This function is used to trim the right hand side as specified in the function Unicode components of

5
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,140
this strength.

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,740
Now you can see the syntax.

7
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:53,290
Here, SDR represent the content is streamed and contest to represent the right hand side elements which

8
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,240
you want to train in the given history.

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:04,750
Now let's go to this school program to illustrate trim right hand side elements from this drink first,

10
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:13,060
creating an initial listening to history using shorthand declaration now declare rest, drink and assign

11
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,350
value to it, which includes a number of exclamation marks and asterisks.

12
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,740
For the example, define a variable like SDR.

13
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:34,450
One column equals, as clearly mentioned, Mark Welcome to go programming

14
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,180
language and asterisk march.

15
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,790
And declare another three and assign value to it, which contains a number of acts and dollar sign.

16
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:56,650
Define another body it in is TR tool column equals at sign outside.

17
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,400
This is the two three on

18
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,420
go link and the other sign dollars sign.

19
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,730
Before training will now display these two variables.

20
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:28,850
First, write a message FP the strings before training and display two variables.

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,690
FP this TR one

22
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:46,160
variable is still and it is fair to call, column and name of disregulated is still true now.

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,070
Training day given the strings using team write function.

24
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:57,290
First, define a variable like result while calling equals from the strings package involved trim write

25
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:57,890
function.

26
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:09,400
First name of a string just to our wall and sit there seemed to be trimmed from the current esteem,

27
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,860
for example, here is asterisk.

28
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:12,940
OK.

29
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,450
The trim right metagenome of the asterisk right hand side of this street value do these for another

30
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,780
variable, but define another variable result.

31
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,840
Two column equals the.

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
There are three right?

33
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,110
Name of a string or two.

34
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,170
And said this seemed to be trimmed from the current listing.

35
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,000
For the example, here is dollar sign.

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,620
Now we want displaying the results after trimming rightist strings value.

37
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:52,600
So copy these three lines and go to this line and paste here and change this value after and change

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:00,970
the result wrong and change your tool to resolve to perform at the code.

39
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:09,670
Save the project and execute the program to the package folder and go wrong.

40
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,830
So it's like, Yes, let's make that go.

41
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,200
Now we can see the output we were able to modify.

42
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,050
Our desired is sitting through the three right function and asterisk, and the other song has removed

43
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,760
from its strings value in order not to prolong the time of position.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,900
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,590
Goodbye.
