00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,870
Hello and welcome to the godown programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,250
ministering in goal.

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,030
And in this session, we want to talk about the audio strings concept.

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,230
Turning left.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,510
This function is used to train the left hand side, the specified in the function Unicode components

6
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,560
of this strings.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,770
Now you can see the syntax.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,550
Here is the already present, the content is strong and contests represent the left hand side elements,

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,310
which you want to train in the given history.

10
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:02,180
Now let's go to this school program to illustrate team left hand side elements from this week.

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,630
First, creating an initializing to a using shorthand declaration in this case, declare a string and

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,120
assign value to it, which includes a number of exclamation marks and an asterisk.

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:33,000
Now define a variable like SDR, one column equals and set value exclamation marks, then come to go

14
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,410
programming

15
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,660
language and asterisk.

16
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,320
Go to the next line and declare another as string and the sound value to it, which contains a number

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,510
of add sign and dollar sign.

18
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,150
Define that even SDR to call equals set value.

19
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,770
Add, sign, add sign.

20
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:10,530
This is to a trio of go lang and dollar sign thylacine

21
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,260
before trimming the now displayed these two variables.

22
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:23,970
If P the strings B4 training

23
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:35,820
and display two variables FP History, or Wong said variable is still unknown.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:50,580
And as the SDR tool and set variable S2 are true, no trimming the given string using trim left function

25
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,880
first define the variable like resolved.

26
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:13,110
One column equals Pichai's strings dot watch three left name of string this TR one and set the string

27
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,850
to be trained from the car.

28
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:23,820
This, for the example here is exclamation marks and the DS for another string resolved to call and

29
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,400
equals the strings by cage.

30
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,270
There are three left name of string.

31
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,180
In this case it is s t r two and set.

32
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,960
This seem to be trained from the car and the setting for the example.

33
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,090
And it's time now we want to display the results after trimming values.

34
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,640
So copy these two lines.

35
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,050
Paste here after trimming.

36
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:11,950
And said Vidal's name resolved long and resolved to reformat the code, save the projects and execute

37
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,850
the program.

38
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:22,930
Now we can see the output, we were able to modify our desired airstream through the train lift function

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,970
and exclamation marks and at songlines remove from string value in order not to prolong the time of

40
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,610
decision.

41
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,560
We will finish it and we will continue to contend in the next session.

42
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,300
Goodbye.
