00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,280
Hello and welcome to the Gold Anchor Academy language course in this issue, and we want to continue

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,570
the variable concept.

3
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,900
In the previous session, we could define the variables without the type.

4
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,460
And in this case, we consider the case where the expression is removed.

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,930
If the expression is removed, then the variable holds zero values for defined like zero four, no false

6
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,980
for Bosnians in need for end fees and response time.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,050
So there is no such concept of an initialized variable in gold language.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,170
Now let's do an example for this case.

9
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:11,130
First, we define two variables that declared in initialize without expiration, so we write that variable

10
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,280
one by the time end and without initialize.

11
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:27,690
Now go to the next line and define another variant and like that value the two by the time string and

12
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,200
VAR

13
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,440
variable three by the time followed.

14
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,690
64.

15
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:53,560
Now displayed a variable, so do the following F.A. dance print of the value of variable one columns

16
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:06,700
per cent, the back slash and insert rally about one and do this print EF four and other variables like

17
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,340
affinity dot print of

18
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:20,890
the value of variable to column because the variable too is studying.

19
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:33,520
So we define per cent s as format testing and practice list and insert variable two and four variable

20
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:33,940
three.

21
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,850
We write a Fenty's Dot Print F

22
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:50,320
the value of variable three columns because the type of variable threes float 64.

23
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:59,740
So we said per cent f as convert to character or format testing for this value of a backslash and set

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,690
variable three.

25
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,640
Now reformat the code, save the project and execute the curriculum.

26
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,880
So go to terminal and run the comment.

27
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,160
Go round backslash.

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,660
May that go.

29
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,020
Now we can see the output.

30
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,010
The value of variable one is zero.

31
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:29,590
The value of variable two is NEEN and the value of variable three is zero point zero.

32
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:36,100
So we could define variables without expression and c the default value for them.

33
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,750
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it.

34
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,690
Then we will continue the content in the next session.

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,410
Goodbye.
