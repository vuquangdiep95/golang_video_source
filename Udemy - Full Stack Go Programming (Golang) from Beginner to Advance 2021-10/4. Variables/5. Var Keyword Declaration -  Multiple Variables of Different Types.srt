Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in this part of your station.

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:26,020
They could define multiple variables of the same type in the single declaration and in decision.

3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,150
We want to do another case.

4
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:37,180
If you remove time, then you are allowed to declare multiple variables of a different type in the single

5
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,910
declaration, the type of value that is determined by the initialized values.

6
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,360
Let's go to do an example.

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,430
First, define multiple variables of different types.

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:01:08,440
So we write that variable in one comma variable two comma variable three and don't define any time for

9
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,150
each variable equals and initialize then.

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:20,110
For example, for the variable one, we set two and four second variable.

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,220
We set a string value, for example, go blank.

12
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:38,150
And for the third variable, we said the float value, for example, six to seven point fifty six.

13
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:46,160
Now we were able to define multiple variables of different tides are declared in initialized in the

14
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,000
single line.

15
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,820
So let's go to display the about variables by the print f function.

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:08,090
So the right thing to do art print off the value of variable number one column setters and these formats

17
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,120
thing for the variable one because the value of it is.

18
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:19,370
And so the type of this variable, should the integer and go to the next section, insert name of variable

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,630
and go to the next line and set a time of the variable.

20
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:43,070
So we write F.A. Dot Print F, the type of variable one column person to operate a case for display.

21
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:52,820
The type of the variable we used from T as formatted string and search name override is variable, so

22
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:59,240
copy these two lines and go to a new line.

23
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:09,530
Paste here for display and other variables, for example, for variable two because it initialized by

24
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,610
the string values.

25
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:19,520
So we change the formatted string to the person s and change name or variable to variable tool

26
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,710
variable two

27
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,690
and four variable three.

28
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:36,380
Because we initialize this variable by the float value, we change it two percent F.

29
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,190
Formatted string.

30
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,640
And we changed name of variable to variable three.

31
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,150
OK.

32
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,630
To be able to display each value in the output on a new line, we use back legend at the end of the

33
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,050
comment.

34
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,250
So the add back is finish and end of each comment.

35
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,020
Reformat the code and save the project and execute the program.

36
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,450
Now go to Terminal First Go Good project folders variables here is getting around the project by the

37
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,410
comment Go wrong, the back is this man that glow.

38
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,580
OK, now we can see the output.

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,320
The value of variable one is two and type of this variable is in the value of second.

40
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,330
Variable is go blank and type of it is extreme and the value are variable.

41
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:02,440
Three is sixty seven point fifty six and the time of this variable is flawed.

42
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,590
So we could define multiple variables of a different type in the singular declaration.

43
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,770
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

44
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,640
the next session.

45
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,420
Goodbye.
