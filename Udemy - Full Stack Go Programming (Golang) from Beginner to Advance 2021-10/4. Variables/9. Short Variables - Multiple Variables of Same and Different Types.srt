00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,030
Hello and welcome to the go and programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,340
We could define the variable through this short variable declaration and indecision vivants to do and

3
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,090
other cases.

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,120
By using short variable declaration, you are allowed to declare multiple variables of the same type

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,770
in the single declaration.

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,530
Now let's do an example.

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,980
First, define 2D variables in line.

8
00:00:47,730 --> 00:01:04,170
So you write that one comma VAR two comma that three column equals and initialize these variable one

9
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,900
by one, for example, for a valid one.

10
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,390
We initialize a hundred four lakh to Rs 200.

11
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:22,740
And for that three the initialize it by 300 we declared and initialized in the single line multiple

12
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,240
variables of same types by using short variable declaration.

13
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:35,460
Now display the value on type of each value, so go to the next line and write it off.

14
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:50,670
Set the message the value all by one columns percent d because the types of the all variable is integer.

15
00:01:50,670 --> 00:02:02,340
So we set from person the assisting format for all variables and that one and go to the next line and

16
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,890
display type of this value to ifdef the tie.

17
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:21,210
All that one column person to uppercase and set by one copy these two lines.

18
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,880
Go to a new line.

19
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:33,840
Paste here and display and other variables that to bar to type is integer

20
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,070
two

21
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,270
and four variable three.

22
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,030
So of use for one person, Diaz formatted string that three.

23
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:04,730
But three and back to OK to be able to display its value in the output on a new line, views from back

24
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,340
east listening at the end of the message of the comment.

25
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,930
So we pulled back a slash and.

26
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,430
The legislation.

27
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:34,290
Reformat the code, save the project and execute the program, go to Terminal First, go to Project

28
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:42,780
Folder, see the variables computer screen and run the program by the Command Go Run thought that's

29
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,190
this made that go.

30
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,730
Now we can see the output.

31
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,220
The value of that of one is 100.

32
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,920
The value of that too is 200, and the value of that tree is 300.

33
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,370
And the types of all variable is it.

34
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,110
Now we want to define another case.

35
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:11,670
Using short variable declaration, you are allowed to declare multiple variables of different types

36
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,960
in the single declaration.

37
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,160
The type of these variables are determined by the expression.

38
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,520
Now let's do an example.

39
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,710
So first, clear the last code.

40
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:39,560
Defined three variable, for example, by one comma, that two comma, that three column equals and

41
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,190
initialize this variable is by different types of value, for example, for VAT of on the initialize

42
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,960
it by integer value.

43
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:58,640
So we set a 100 for it and for that two of initialize it by a string value, for example, gold programming

44
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:10,100
and for third value about the initialize it by a float value, for example, eighty six point fifty

45
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,490
four.

46
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,290
We declared and initialized in the single line multiple variables of different types by using short

47
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,940
variable declaration now displayed a value on type of the variables.

48
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:40,250
So we write f f the value of that one column per cent because the type of variable one is integer.

49
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:50,690
So we use from Person D as formatted and set that one go to the next line and display type of variable

50
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,810
f f it tie.

51
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,060
Oh, that one column per cent to all parties and set that one.

52
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:12,680
Now copied these two lines and go to a new line, paste here and define another variable for it.

53
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:22,400
For example, right to be changed format formatted string two per cent s because that type of valuable

54
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,450
to is string.

55
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:40,780
And for variable three, he changed five three and we changed conversion character two percent f because

56
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:54,970
the type of batteries followed by a tree, that tree, that tree and set it back as much and in the

57
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,960
end of message of each line back is less.

58
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,340
And I guess that's.

59
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:20,930
OK, now reformat the call, save the project and execute the program, go to Terminal, Go Round Dot

60
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,180
practice and make that go.

61
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:31,910
Now we can see the output, the value of that often is 100 and type of it is ain't the value of that

62
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:39,140
to his GO program and type of it is a strength and the value of that tree is a six point fifty four

63
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,870
and type of it is flawed 64 sixty war.

64
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:49,310
So we could define multiple variables of different times in the single declaration by using shorthand

65
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,570
variable declaration.

66
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,060
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

67
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,960
the next session.

68
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,620
Goodbye.
