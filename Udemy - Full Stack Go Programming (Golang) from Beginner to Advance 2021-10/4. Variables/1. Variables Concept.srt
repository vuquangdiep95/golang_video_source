00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,580
Hello and welcome to go down to the Jeromy language course in this session, we want to talk about variable

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,270
concept.

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,870
Variables variables are like boxes.

4
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,520
Each of each has a specific type, and you can store values to the boxes based of its type.

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,280
We might be limited by our programming language, but as shown above, integer float, Boolean and string

6
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:51,750
are certain the options to be stored in a variable as storing data.

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,590
A variable is a place holder of the information, which can be changed and wrong.

8
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,960
Time and variables allow to retrieve and manipulate the stored information in any programming language.

9
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,100
A variable is used to store the data or the value that is used in the program for execution.

10
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:21,330
The value that is is stored in the variable can be used or modify in the later part of the execution.

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,280
For example, a int equals a hundred.

12
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,530
Here a is the variable that is towards the value of 100.

13
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,430
The data type defined is integer, hence a canister only the integer values.

14
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,360
Go variables and go language, a variable holds data temporarily to work with it.

15
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:56,450
A go line variable declaration needs for things first, a statement that declaring the goal and variable.

16
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,130
Second, a name for the variable.

17
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,440
Toured the type of data it can hold.

18
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,080
And force an initial value for it.

19
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:18,990
Fortunately, some of the parts are optional, but that also means there is more than one way of defining

20
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,340
a variable in gold.

21
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,020
Go variables include language variables are created in two different.

22
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:38,980
First, using Varkey Keyboard and go language variables are created using bad keyboard at a particular

23
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,570
time, connected with name and provides its initial value.

24
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:54,640
Now you can see the syntax that variable name type equals two value.

25
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,920
Second, using short variable declaration, the local variables, which are declared and initialized

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,300
in the functions, are declared by using short variable declaration.

27
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,530
Now you can see the syntax variable name column equals value.

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,230
Now we want to know some important things about governing variables.

29
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,390
First, Go Lang is a particular type language.

30
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,100
This means that when Golang variables are declared, they either explicitly or implicitly assigned a

31
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,920
type even before your program runs.

32
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:49,090
Second, Go Lang requires that every variable you declare inside main function get used some very popular

33
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,280
term.

34
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:58,900
You can assign new value to existing variable, but the value needs to be a same type force.

35
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:05,410
A variable declared within both branches may be accessed anywhere within the block.

36
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,470
The opening curly braces introduces a new scope that ends with the closing brace.

37
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,570
Either blocks can access variables within out or blocks, but out of block cannot access variables within

38
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,470
inner blocks.

39
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,680
Rules for naming variables.

40
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:39,010
First, variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore, and the names may contain the letters

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:50,950
a til z lowercase or a P Z uppercase or digits zero till nine, as well as the character underscore.

42
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,480
In this example, we have defined two variables.

43
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,910
Gene is the first variable who is first letter is capital genes.

44
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:08,560
Second variable in which all letters are lowercase characters and under a scorching 123.

45
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,210
The third variable, who is first letter, begins with an owner, a school and all three variables are

46
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,440
named correctly.

47
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,660
Second and variable name should not to start with a digit.

48
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:32,470
In this example, we define the variable called a hundred three came, and since the variable is sparse

49
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,310
with the number.

50
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,600
These vary a bit, is not named correctly and is illegal.

51
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,120
Third, the name of the variable is case sensitive.

52
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,870
In this example, you have defined 280 adults in three ways team with lowercase letters and keen that

53
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,230
all the letters are uppercase and queen, who is first letter is uppercase character.

54
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,130
And the naming of all three variable is done correctly.

55
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:13,970
Fourth, key vote is not allowed to use as a variable name, the GO programming language has a serious

56
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:22,940
of key wars that cannot be used to define variables such as VAR for extract and search.

57
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:33,190
Fifth, there is no limit on the length of the name of the variable, but it is advisable to use an

58
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:40,960
optimum length of 14 15 letters only like first name, last name.

59
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:52,940
Sixth, the convention go is to use missed caps rather than underscores to ride multi wars names like

60
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:00,980
the Vote Bear state, where the second part of the vote means debate begins with a capital letter in

61
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,560
order not to prolong the time of decision.

62
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,520
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

63
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,290
Goodbye.
