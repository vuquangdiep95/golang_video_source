Hello and welcome to the golems programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,470
We could define variable without assigning it and go land automatically will bind the default value

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,250
to the variable.

4
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,580
And in this session, we want to do another case variables declaration can be grouped together into

5
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,180
blocks for greater readability and good quality.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,590
So let's do an example to do this.

7
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:53,220
First, use the VAD keyboard and then create open and close practices and define its variable between

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,120
parentheses.

9
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:03,760
So we write that he will open and close prophecies and define variables between them.

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:11,220
For example, first name initialise by the value chain.

11
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,960
Go to the next line.

12
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,240
Define another variable like no one equals 300.

13
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:27,220
And number two equals twenty point sixty five.

14
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,950
And define another variable like mad8 equals.

15
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,610
True.

16
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:42,580
In this case, we defined four variables by the type string integer float and Boolean.

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,770
Now go out of the ballpark and display these variables.

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,900
So we write FP first name.

19
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,010
Go to the next line FP No.

20
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,330
One and display No.

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,210
Two

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,360
and display Boolean variable merit.

23
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,310
OK.

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,310
Reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

25
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:30,430
So go to Terminal first to screen, go to Project Folder, see the variables and run the program by

26
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,970
the comment.

27
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,100
Go run the text.

28
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,740
That's me that go.

29
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,190
Now we can see the output.

30
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,840
In this case, we could define variables.

31
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,870
Declaration can be grouped together into blocks in order not to prolong the time of decision.

32
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,190
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

33
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:54,880
Goodbye.
