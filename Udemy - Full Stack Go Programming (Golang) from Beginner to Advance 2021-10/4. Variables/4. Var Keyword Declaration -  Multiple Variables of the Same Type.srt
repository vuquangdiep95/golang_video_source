00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:19,010
Hello and welcome to the Go programming language course in the previous session, we could define variables

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,410
without expression and indecision.

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,930
Do you want to do another case?

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,270
If you use time, then you are allowed to declare multiple variables of the same time in the single

5
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:32,990
declaration.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,950
For this case, we define three variables in line.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:49,340
So we write that define variable name like variable, one comma defined and another variable name variable

8
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,850
two comma and variable three.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,070
And these three variables has the same type line integer.

10
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,480
And now we initialize them one by one for variable one.

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:14,390
For example, we set two comma for second variable or variable to be set, for example, 403 and fifty

12
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,070
four and four variable three we set, for example, sixty seven.

13
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:28,070
We were able to define multiple variables of the same time are declared and initialized in a single

14
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,670
line.

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,920
Now go to the next line and display the values of these variables.

16
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,770
If and you don't treat if

17
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:53,210
the value of vanity building one column percent, the back is less an insert variable.

18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,800
One, we said Person D as formatted sitting because all the variable has the integer type.

19
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,600
So copy these lines and paste it for another variable.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,360
And now change the variable names and messages variable to

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,790
valuable tool and three insert variable three.

22
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,640
Now reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,420
Just go to a terminal, go to a project folder.

24
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,700
See the variables.

25
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:53,320
Clearer screen and execute program by the comment Go Run Dot matches, less Maine dot gov.

26
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,670
Now we can see the output.

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,880
The value of variable one is to the value of variable to is four hundred and fifty four and the value

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,980
of variable 367.

29
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:14,500
So in this case, we could define multiple variables of the same type in the single declaration in order

30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,550
not to prolong the time of decision.

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,620
We will finish it, then we will continue the content in the next session.

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,340
Goodbye.
