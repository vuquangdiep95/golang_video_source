00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,020
Hello and welcome to go programming language.

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,980
I am happy Tourism Resume Year is director of these training course with more than 20 years of programming

3
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:32,890
experience in C, C++, C Sharp Dot Net, Java as free Python Goal and Flutter and other programming

4
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,310
languages in this course.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:44,260
I have tried to fully teach the concepts of girl programming language from basic to advanced, so every

6
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,720
individual at any level of programming could start this course and it completely.

7
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,760
Even if you have no knowledge of programming and want to get acquainted with the programming language

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,150
for the first time, do not worry, because this course is designed in such a way that you can learn

9
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,740
programming concepts from basic to advanced and easily learn the course.

10
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:16,690
This course begins with simple concepts such as installing go land on the operating system, defining

11
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:23,590
variables, data types and operators, and will go on with the intermediate concepts like collection

12
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:31,210
pointers, concurrency files and directories, and will be concluded with advanced concepts including

13
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,060
database GWR in Political Boffa, G.R., PC, Rest API and web socket.

14
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:44,530
Nowadays, several points have to be considered important when using a programming language, some of

15
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:50,740
which will be a stated first connection between programming, language and database.

16
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,690
For this purpose, in this course, we have completed the database training and examine its concepts

17
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,590
from the beginning.

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:07,210
For example, a programmer needs E r diagram knowledge to connect his program to a database in order

19
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,790
to be able to design and display his database according to his needs in the applications.

20
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:20,200
In this course, we will explain to you how to design a database and with what symbols its components

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,600
are displayed so that any other program that can see and implement the E.R. diagram.

22
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:32,080
In addition, implementing a database is done in such a way that the program that has the possibility

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,020
to use DUR database wherever they want.

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:42,160
In this way, the database is made as dynamic, which does not depend on any a specific class or restaurant,

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,450
and is a step.

26
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,910
You first get acquainted with the database commands and do examples in the next step.

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,220
You do the goal in connection with the database and implement the project in this field.

28
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:01,120
Then, in the advanced steps, you can use the GAWIN framework, which is a popular framework in the

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,600
go language to connect the go to the database.

30
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:11,800
In this tutorial, devel known MySQL database is explained and used it in the projects, but you will

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,440
also be able to use other databases.

32
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,820
Second, relationship between the programming language and other programming languages or different

33
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,600
services.

34
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,690
In other words, the programming language must be able to communicate with the outside world.

35
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:37,210
Nowadays, various technologies such as Protocol, G.R., PC and RESTful are used to carry this important

36
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,600
job.

37
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:45,100
I will explain and implement these three technologies in details through different projects, and we

38
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:51,910
use a combination of different technologies such as database JSON, restful GI PC protocol buffer in

39
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,290
the project separately.

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:02,110
For example, I will communicate with the server food and blister edit or delete data in the database

41
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,140
or fetch them by learning these technologies.

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,100
You will be able to implement various types of programs on the web and connect to other services or

43
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,450
applications without having knowledge of the programming, language and exchange data with them.

44
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:26,980
Third, concurrency topic as processors became more powerful, endure processing capacity increased.

45
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,670
Programmers thought they could use the increase in prices, of course, to increase the speed and performance

46
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,530
of their applications and to perform many of the operations of the program in parallel.

47
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:46,300
One of the teams that every programmer pays attention, any programming language is the topic of concurrency

48
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,540
in order to properly manage the execution of the program.

49
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,720
In parallel, concurrency is one of the most important things in learning go language, which makes

50
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,020
the program created with the language very powerful and fast.

51
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,620
In this course, we will talk about this topic in full detail and give various examples for that subject.

52
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,450
Let's Typekit can be considered a bigger step in improving the performance of web applications that

53
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:13,680
require.

54
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:20,410
And real time data exchange, and even today they are showing up in many multi-user online games and

55
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,520
chat applications.

56
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,880
That's like it is a protocol for establishing a two way fast connection between client and server.

57
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:35,140
The purpose of introducing this protocol is to minimize the delays caused by your request response communication

58
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,070
HTP, contrary to the methods introduced earlier.

59
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,060
That's Typekit is a protocol based on TCP and different from Stibbe, which allows a permanent two way

60
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,090
communication between the client and the server, only to a single port in this tutorial.

61
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,770
I will fully explain the vets socket and implement the chat project in different lines.

62
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,550
I will also create a web layer in which a chat project will have the ability to ask and receive messages

63
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,340
from the browser in addition to different clients.

64
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,300
In the end, by finishing this training course, you will become a goal and developer and will be able

65
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:20,230
to implement various programs and projects with goal language such as networking, distributed fonctionne

66
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,440
service APIs, that service rep applications and their communications with clients.

67
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,120
Minimal frameworks for web applications and alike in the best possible way.

68
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:38,950
For all the lessons of this course, slides have been prepared, aligned with pictures, tables and

69
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:45,890
diagrams, which you will see during the training so that the important and key concepts are fully explained.

70
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,570
Also, examples have been presented for all the lessons of this training course, which could be easily

71
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,170
accessed.

72
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,410
The best connection between us is the Q&amp;A section.

73
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,540
You can ask your questions there and get the right answers.

74
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:08,590
Please ask any questions in the related section so that I can give you the right answer as soon as possible.

75
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,950
I hope you finish this training course successfully and enjoy programming with Go Like Goodbye.
