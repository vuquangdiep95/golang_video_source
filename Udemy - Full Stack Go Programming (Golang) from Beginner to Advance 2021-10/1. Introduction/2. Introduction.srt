00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,430
Hello and welcome to the Go Line programming language course.

2
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:30,440
And introduction to Go Lanc Go is an Open-Source programming language.

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,260
It's a statically typed and produces compiled mixing code binaries.

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:45,770
Developers say that Google's goal language is the sea for a 21st century when it comes to syntax.

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:55,340
This meal programming language includes tooling that allows you to safely use memory, manage optics,

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,500
collect garbage and provide aesthetic typing along with concurrency.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,330
Best features of GO programming language compiled.

8
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,500
Garbage collected, designed for multiple processors and easy to read quotes.

9
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:23,960
The main goal of creating GO was to combine the best features of other programming languages, such

10
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:31,880
as ease of use with state of the art productivity, high level efficiency, along with the static typing

11
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,610
and advanced performance for networking and the full use of multicore power.

12
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,730
You might want to know why gore is rising.

13
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,590
The reason is that Go has the same performance as C and is much easier to maintain that your wall as

14
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,770
we need no virtual machine, no warning or period and no jar, hell and so on.

15
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:03,790
Let's have a look at the other Gauland advantages that spanned less time and money to develop an app.

16
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:12,310
You don't need a huge take a stack if you are using go for your project, ask, create and then go language,

17
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,250
actually compile to native machine code and don't need any interpreter or virtual machine.

18
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:27,250
These are some means that GO apps will work faster and won't require the warming up, we have just mentioned

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,330
use go for a range of apps.

20
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,200
Go is a really flexible language able to solve a lot of problems.

21
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,180
You can use it for system and network programming, big data, machine learning, audio and video editing

22
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,900
and more.

23
00:02:52,910 --> 00:03:02,090
Get more performance at a wider audience for your app similarly to C or C++.

24
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,650
Go is a compiled language and doesn't require any interpretation.

25
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:15,080
Correspondingly, the absence of an interpreter frees up power and gives a go build app way more performance,

26
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,320
which will surely be appreciated by users.

27
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,500
Moreover, God knows how to properly manage allocated memory.

28
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,970
More good news is that a Google based application is less demanding in terms of system requirements.

29
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,750
This is good for users with all their devices as they will get to enjoy your app too.

30
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,610
And with more people using your application, you will be getting more money.

31
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:58,540
Worry less about the app crashing, though, was created to use the full potential of multiple course.

32
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:06,010
Moreover, the language can properly use all the processor resources, so it's perfect for running an

33
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,440
app in the background as a single process.

34
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,180
This is possible thanks to go routines which are used instead of threats and require much less ram due

35
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,250
to their known system threat nature.

36
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,560
This is why the risk of a Go app crashing due to lack of memory is lower.

37
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,470
Is it a fine go developers for your project going is blowing up?

38
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,910
If you look at the 2018 developers survey by the Stack Overflow, you will see that go is one, the

39
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,360
top five most loved and most wanted languages.

40
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,440
More and more professionals are diving into the world of Go, according to recent research.

41
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:55,190
You can only define over one million six hundred and thirty three thousand GO developers on the market

42
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:03,260
in 2018, which is a 60 percent increase compared to 2017, according to the Google survey.

43
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,790
More and more contributors to go are coming from the go community.

44
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,620
This also means that there are more and more people becoming go professionals.

45
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,970
Developers can easily sample GO apps.

46
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,770
There is a serious advantage for those who aren't ready to hire a go expert for support and maintenance.

47
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,200
Go Court has clear and neat syntax and requires little effort to learn.

48
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,520
So developers, you already what we can learn all they need to within just a couple of days.

49
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,020
This will allow your developers to support your existing app.

50
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,110
What are the advantages of using go for your project?

51
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,870
Why is good language popular?

52
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,850
Besides the cute mascot, Go brings a whole set of advantages.

53
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:05,660
The language began rising almost as soon as it was released back in 2009.

54
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,840
It quickly a start, drifting from the number 65 language toward the top positions around the world.

55
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,800
Then Business Insider called gold.

56
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,860
The hottest programming language of 2016, according to the Thiel Index.

57
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,810
Goes rating went way up and a bit down in 2017.

58
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,410
But in 2018, it has continuously gone up, as shown in the graph below.

59
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,610
Rank.

60
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:49,650
These diagrams summarize the result of our December 2018 user survey, along with our commentary and

61
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,310
insights.

62
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:58,020
We are grateful to everyone who provided their feedback to the survey to help shape the future of go

63
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,460
like we asked about people's expertise and preference among programming languages.

64
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:13,380
Go ranked highest amount respondents first choices in both expertise and preference.

65
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,540
Expertise well, in this chart, based on statistics, we actually showed a ranking of programming languages

66
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,340
based on your expertise.

67
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:33,370
As you can see, go language is about 90 percent, Python 56 percent and Java 42 percent.

68
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:43,210
And finally, C++ 24 until five-person your specialty go languages is still top of the expert line diagram.

69
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:56,210
Preferences and the other diagram based on this statistic that show that the preferences of programming

70
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:04,190
languages, as you can see go language is about nine to three percent, Python fifty three percent and

71
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:15,350
Rust 90 percent and finally C++ 18 and B 11 percent GO is clearly attracting many programmers from dynamic

72
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,100
languages.

73
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:27,630
What projects can you use go for gore will definitely do the trick if you are planning to develop down

74
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,710
the line services for your application.

75
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,690
More than that, gore is good for scalable, high performance apps.

76
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:43,750
We list some apps and services that are enjoying the benefits of Google Cloud services as the creator

77
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,290
of Google.

78
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,700
Google is using the language to provide cloud infrastructure.

79
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,190
It offers top performance and its capability to the Google Cloud platform.

80
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:00,130
But there are even more well-known cloud businesses out there are using Google for the same reason,

81
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,550
such as Dropbox Turf for Kubernetes and Dutcher media platforms.

82
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:16,380
YouTube, SoundCloud and Netflix choose Go to fight with high loads on their sites, SoundCloud uses

83
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:23,730
this language for deploying some internal services within their complex projects on demand services.

84
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:32,670
The toxic giant over was looking to improve map processing speeds as people loaded geo fence look ups,

85
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,050
sending literally thousands of queries per second.

86
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,400
Go ahead!

87
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:46,560
Uber significantly reduce the timing of providing services to users, which was much appreciated by

88
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,130
users.

89
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,240
Aside from the services and products, Google provides key tooling for mobile app development.

90
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,830
This is why we will soon see even more examples of going mobile applications and propelling some other

91
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,240
industries as well.

92
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,890
Also, Go is still a relatively young programming language.

93
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:17,340
It has gained popularity among real business masters like Google, Netflix or Uber and others who use

94
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:24,180
Go to scale their products innovative high performance goals, quickly changing for a base, providing

95
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,700
more and more tools for mobile and web development.

96
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:33,720
And remarkably, decreasing the time and cost of app development and software news outlets.

97
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:42,390
Back in 2012, BBC started using goal language for backend development and some of the elements of their

98
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,340
internal analytics services.

99
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
Go Lang designers.

100
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:55,530
Google was produced in 2007 and launched in 2009 and introduced to the public.

101
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,330
Robert Creamer dropped Pike and Ken Thompson are Google's top three go programming language designers.

102
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:10,110
The trial started with the goal of creating a language similar to the C programming language that is

103
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:16,920
a part of a fool, as it is which eventually launched into the modern programming language, object

104
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,800
oriented pointer, his methods and etc..

105
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,940
And as a result, were able to launch a high performance, fast and efficient language to market and

106
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,320
introduce to the public.

107
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,550
Competition between five language by according benchmarks, well, a competition has been made between

108
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:45,600
the top five programming languages by benchmarks based on hardware and software amount, which the go

109
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,150
language is still at the top of the other languages in the table and occupies about 80 percent C-sharp.

110
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:01,200
Also 79 percent, not jazz, 74 percent Java 17 and Python six to eight percent.

111
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:09,300
And in hardware and software items such as memory, CPU, serialization, error handling and ET all

112
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,200
have been compared in escort.

113
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:21,450
The best ideas for Golang development, according to statistics conducted by Golang programming, was

114
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,010
the percentage of programming environments used for these language.

115
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,520
Ease is statistically expressed in this chart.

116
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,940
We can see the uses of each of the integrated development environments, so we see go land.

117
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,990
Top of the others by Terry five percent inverse code.

118
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,810
About twenty two percent and see the others.

119
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:53,260
And in the end, I hope you can communicate well with the go language and method is powerful and efficient

120
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,250
language and enjoy the word of the go programming language.
