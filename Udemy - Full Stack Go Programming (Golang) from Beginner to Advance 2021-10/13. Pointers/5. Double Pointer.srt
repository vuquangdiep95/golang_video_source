00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,380
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the television station, we talked about

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,100
competing pointers and Googling and indecision, and we want to talk about the other's point first concept.

3
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:39,320
Go pointer to point to or domino pointer, the pointer is especially bad either, so it can point to

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,200
a variable of any time even to a pointer.

5
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,690
Basically, this looks like a chain of pointers when we define the pointer to pointer, then the first

6
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,200
pointer is used to restore the actress of the second pointer.

7
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,460
This concept is sometimes termed as double pointers.

8
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:08,700
Hard to declare a pointer to pointer and go land the pointer to a pointer is a form of chain of pointers.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,750
Normally, a pointer contains the address of a very.

10
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,380
Then we define a pointer to a coin to the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer.

11
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,470
Each points to the location that contains the actual value, as shown below.

12
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,970
A very bad that is a pointer to a pointer must be declared as such.

13
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,220
This is done by placing an additional asterisk in front of its name.

14
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,610
For example, the following statement declares a pointer to a pointer of type int.

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:57,010
That Peter, three, Asterix, each time when the target value is indirectly pointed to by a pointer

16
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:03,700
to a pointer, accessing that value requires that the asterisk operator be applied twice.

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,440
Now, go to this good program to illustrate the concept of pointer to pointer.

18
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,110
First, taking a variable of integer type that.

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,010
Peaks and equals 100.

20
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,290
Now, taking a pointer of the time that.

21
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:30,930
P.

22
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:40,510
T one Asterix E equals actress of East Valley, the Anderson he's

23
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:52,840
now taking pointer to pointer to Pete Yvonne is touring the actress of Pizjuan into PETA to vie Pete

24
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:02,050
to asterisk, asterisk and equals actress of Pointer Rock Anderson.

25
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:11,740
Petey won't now display EEGs and Petey and PETA variables if IFBB.

26
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:22,330
The value of X equals said the value of the Ace go to the next line.

27
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,060
Fifty.

28
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,150
The dragging you off.

29
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,770
He t one equals set point to a long.

30
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,890
And go to the next line.

31
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,750
If we.

32
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,850
The value.

33
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,380
Home to two equals and set the value a pointer to.

34
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,450
Reformat the quote.

35
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,960
Now referencing the pointer to pointer.

36
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,160
Yes, he.

37
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,140
Value at the address.

38
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:29,000
Of pointer to or has to expand to two equals, that's two pointer to and double pointer bequeathed the

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,690
value of variable X if P

40
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,870
value.

41
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,090
At the at risk.

42
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,100
Point to two or.

43
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,540
Asterisk, asterisk, p t two equals

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,040
six, that's p t.

45
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,510
To reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

46
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:17,100
Now we can see the output first, we see the value of the variable X, which is a hundredth.

47
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,700
Then we see the value of the variable points or one in which the address of the variable X is a thought.

48
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,080
And then we see the value of the variable point or two in which the address of the variable point to

49
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,100
one is distort.

50
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,210
And now you see the address of the variable pointer two.

51
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:45,890
And finally, we see the value of the variable points or two, which is preceded by two asterisks.

52
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,220
We have reached the end of decision.

53
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,440
I hope you have taken full advantage of this station onto next session.

54
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,190
Goodbye.
