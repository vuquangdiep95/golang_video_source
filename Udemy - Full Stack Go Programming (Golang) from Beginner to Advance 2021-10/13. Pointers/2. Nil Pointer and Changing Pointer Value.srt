00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,900
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course.

2
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:26,070
In the previous session, we talked about declaration and initialization of pointers in this session.

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,160
We want to talk about the others pointers concept.

4
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:43,190
Neil, pointers in goo goo compiler assign initial value to a pointer very bad in case you don't have

5
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,230
exact address to be assigned.

6
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:54,360
This is done at the time of variable declaration, a pointer that is assigned Neal is called in need

7
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,980
of pointer.

8
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:05,960
The need point there is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries to check

9
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,670
for a need point where you can use and if a statement as follows.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,960
Now go to this code and illustrate how to declaring Neil pointers.

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:34,380
First, define the point of a variable valve p star and now do the following code for check need or

12
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,770
not.

13
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,360
If

14
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,500
P equals, he calls mean

15
00:01:46,500 --> 00:02:00,450
so display the message if if the value of B is first x lowercase back is less and and.

16
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,190
He.

17
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,840
He the quote, save the project and execute the program.

18
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,810
Now we can see the output, the value of P is zero.

19
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:25,600
On most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address zero because

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
that memory is reserved by the operating system.

21
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,310
However, the memorial address zero has a special significance.

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,230
It signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an accessible memory location, but by convention.

23
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:47,030
If a pointer contains the needle or zero value, it is assumed to point to nothing.

24
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,340
Now go to your slides and continue.

25
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:03,900
Changing Poland to a value, you can also change the value of the to or the memory location instead

26
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,780
of assigning annual value to the value of it.

27
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,360
Now go to this good program to illustrate the above mentioned concept.

28
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,780
First, clear, the last court.

29
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,580
And save the project.

30
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,340
It's ready to write code.

31
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,480
First, create a variable using vata keyboard, and we are not defining any type of value, but for

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,540
the example, via a equals 458.

33
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:47,360
Now taking a point Revathi been using via Ward without specifying the type that P equals.

34
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,010
Signed a value that.

35
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:01,530
Display value of every bit and avarice of every bit and pawn in therapy before changing.

36
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:18,230
FP value stored in a variable equals a go to the next time.

37
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,890
FP.

38
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:30,790
Address a rally there, he calls Anderson a.

39
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:43,470
And go to the next line if P value stored in pointer.

40
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:57,750
T equals and set the value of the P here before the code and say the project now using Asterix or Create

41
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,600
will be for points are very able to access.

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:10,050
The value is stored at the very well at which is it is pointing now write the code if P value.

43
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,350
It's taught in.

44
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:28,770
Star P before changing, he calls the star P.

45
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,990
Save the project, go to terminal and execute the program until here.

46
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:53,190
Now we can see the output value soared in a able equals 458 address of a variable and value a sort in

47
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:04,500
point or p r, the hexadecimal format and value is stored in Astra's before changing equals 458.

48
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Now go to code and change value off point or go to the next line.

49
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:20,960
Changing the value of a variable by assigning the new value to the pointer is star p equals for the

50
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:27,810
example five hundred and go to the next line and again display.

51
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:44,130
The value is stored in asterisks p if p value is stored in star b after changing.

52
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:57,480
Equals and set the variable a reformat, the quote saved the project and go terminal and execute again.

53
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:08,060
Now we can see the output value restored in this star after changing equals five hundred.

54
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:17,360
In this example, the first define a very bad and initialize it, then put the address of that variable

55
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
inside and pointer.

56
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:27,710
Now, by changing the pointer value, we will see that the value inside the initial variable also changes.

57
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,850
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

58
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,960
the next session.

59
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,770
Goodbye.
