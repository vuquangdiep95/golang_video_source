00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,220
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,890
sending a into a function in goal.

3
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,380
And in this session, we want to talk about the other's point first concept.

4
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:39,130
Comparing pointers in gold and in gold language, you are allowed to compare two pointers with each

5
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:39,550
other.

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:47,200
Two pointers values are only equal, then they point to the same value in the memory or if they are

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:55,420
needed, you can perform a conversion on pointers with the help of equal two and not equal to operators

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,730
provided by the gold language.

9
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:07,750
Now you can see the syntax go to this good program and illustrate how to use competing pointers in gold

10
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,350
language.

11
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:22,390
First, create an initialized to actual variable for the example, value one column equals 100.

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,390
And the next line value two equals 200.

13
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:36,280
Now create three pointers and initialize them by the address of allow variables.

14
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:48,790
For the example, P1 call equals person value one and P2 calling equals ampersand value.

15
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:56,170
Two and P3 column equals ampersand again.

16
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,860
Value one.

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,350
Now, compare two pointers together and put the result as a Boolean value in a valid for the example

18
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:14,440
he compared to pointers P one and P two and set results in the result more valuable.

19
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:26,110
Now do the following result long column equals p one equal to p to.

20
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:33,490
By this quote, we can compare to variable and set result in another value the display.

21
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,040
The result of this conversion FP

22
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,380
result from.

23
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,000
He's.

24
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,210
P. Long, equal

25
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,260
and assets, the result one.

26
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:07,210
So let's do a few more conversions for the example, conversion between P1 and P3 now write results

27
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:28,720
to calling equals P1 equal to P3 and display the result if be resolved to these P1 equals.

28
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:43,210
P three and sit to resolve to leave it to other competition for the example, competition between P2

29
00:03:43,210 --> 00:04:07,000
and P3 resolved three Kollin equals P2 equal to P3 display the result FP resolved three E's P two equal

30
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:15,110
P three and set the result three rated here.

31
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,060
OK.

32
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:26,290
We will now compare the addresses of the -- to available together, for the example addresses of two

33
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:39,450
pointers of Pilon and P. to define resolved for call and he calls and some p for equal to Anderson P

34
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:47,980
three and display the result for FP Zonked for.

35
00:04:49,810 --> 00:05:02,560
He's P one, equal P three and set the result for here.

36
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,050
Vom and PETA.

37
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:17,110
And the other condition, for example, competition between P1 and P2 resolved fight calling equals

38
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:36,880
nine percent P1 equal to Anderson P two and especially the result five if P result five is P1 equaled

39
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,550
P2 asset, the variable result five.

40
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:57,820
And another conversion for the example between P2 and P3 result six current equals countersign p to

41
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:04,570
equal to Anderson P3 and display the result.

42
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:19,710
FP results six is P2 equal P3 and set the result six variable here.

43
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,940
Now reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

44
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,970
Now we can see outputs in all these competitions.

45
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:42,710
Only the variable Piven is equal to P3 and in the regional two variable, the answer to is sort for

46
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,010
us.

47
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:51,620
And the other countries are not equal to each other and show us the false answer in order not to prolong

48
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,760
the time of decision.

49
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,050
You will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

50
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,770
Goodbye.
