00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,400
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous sessions.

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,070
We talked about declaration and initialization as lysis and indecision.

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,770
We want to talk about the other nice this concept.

4
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,070
Iterate over a slice.

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:45,930
You can iterate over is nice using the following base first using faux loop, second using range and

6
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,070
follow third, using a blank identifier in falou and phones using for loop as buy.

7
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,400
Now go to the Escott program to illustrate how to use iterating over a slice.

8
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,770
Watching in this hamper, we want to talk about iterate over a slice by using for loop first creating

9
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,630
a slice.

10
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:22,920
This five column he calls this group rockets type is aimed at initialize value by 10, 20, 30, 40,

11
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,610
50, 60 and 70.

12
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:34,650
Now, iterate this slice using follow through the following four I call it equals zero.

13
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:44,040
I list the LEN of slice and I + +.

14
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:54,030
We put the condition here for continue to follow, so we use lean function for set the condition and

15
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:02,090
it means I less than seven now display the element of a slice in each increment, right?

16
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,790
FP

17
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:15,300
it's nice the square brackets and set the index I reformatted to save the projects and execute it.

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:26,160
Now we can see the output and we could display elements of a slice from 10 to 70 by full loop.

19
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,750
Now, do another example.

20
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,820
First clear of the last quote.

21
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,100
In this case, we want to iterate over this list using range in loop.

22
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,630
So do the following four index.

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,360
Common value Cullen equals range.

24
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,920
And it's nice variable here is it's nice.

25
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:06,190
And now he's been the index and value for each element of this nice if there.

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,430
Index he calls cent the and

27
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,820
value.

28
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:35,470
He calls her sandy and slush and and sets the very bad index and value reform at the school, save the

29
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,330
project and execute the code.

30
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:40,600
OK.

31
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:48,370
We can see the output we could display indexes and values of a nice elements from 10 to 17 by using

32
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,170
ranging for.

33
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
Now do another example.

34
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,520
First clear of the last code.

35
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,160
In this sample, we want to iterate over a slice using a blank identifier in for loop.

36
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:15,400
So do the following four underscore comma error value column equals branch in this slice validator.

37
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,620
Now write the value if

38
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:37,630
the value equals person and bank is this end and sets the value of the value before you make the call

39
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,570
and save and execute the code.

40
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,970
OK, we can't see the output.

41
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,440
We could display a slice elements from 10 to 70 by using range info look without an index.

42
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,890
Now, to another example, first clear last quote.

43
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,190
In this sandpit, we want to iterate over a slice by using faux loop as volume.

44
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:17,880
First, define the local variable as a counter for the example I call an equal zero as a counter and

45
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:29,250
right for loop flow range a slice and this fillet the value of a slice.

46
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,840
For the example, FP is sliced.

47
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,780
Yes, global markets index I.

48
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:46,370
Now, increase the counter after use print and dry eye plus plus reformat the code, save the project

49
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,930
and execute the program.

50
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:58,370
Now we can see the output and we could display its nice elements from 10 to 70 by using Falou as a wine

51
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,410
indecision.

52
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,250
We could iterate over a slice in several different ways in order not to prolong the time of decision.

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,090
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

54
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,720
Goodbye.
