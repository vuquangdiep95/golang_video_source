00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,100
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the pit of your station, we talked about

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,550
append this nice to an existing is nice English language and in decision we want to talk about the other.

3
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,840
It's nice concept.

4
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,910
Multi-dimensional a slice.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,910
Multi-dimensional stories are just like the multi-dimensional array, except that it's nice, does not

6
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,020
contain this size.

7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,770
Now go to the good program to illustrate how to implement multi-dimensional slides and go language.

8
00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:00,480
First, create a multi-dimensional slice for the example, a slice one collar equals set twist core

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:13,680
brackets first and second and define tie for the example end and initialize the values first, 10,

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:24,150
comma 20 and set the comma end of the credit markets and goes to the next line and define another values.

11
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:37,110
For the example, 30, 40 and 50 set the comma end of the brackets and go to the next line and initialize

12
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,810
and other values, for the example.

13
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:51,840
60, 70, 80 and 90 and set the common end of the early brackets and go to the next line.

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:02,310
And we initialize the order values, for the example, at a hundred and a hundred and twenty and set

15
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,980
the common end of the curly brackets.

16
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,430
Now go to the next line and display.

17
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:19,710
This slice might even help to slice and dice, reformat the code, save the project and execute the

18
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,160
code.

19
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,800
Now we can see the output and we could define multidimensional slices.

20
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,190
We have reached the end of this session.

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,290
I hope you have taken full advantage of decision on the next decision.

22
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,910
Goodbye.
