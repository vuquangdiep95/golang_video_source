00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,550
Hello and welcome to the Golden Programming Languages course in the previous session.

2
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,580
We talked about creating slides using already existing slice and indecision.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,850
We want to talk about the others as nice concepts.

4
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,120
Create this slice using main function.

5
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,160
You can also create this nice using the made function, which is provided by the Go library.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,160
This function takes three parameters time, lengths and capacity here.

7
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:04,300
Capacity values Optionally, it assigns an underlying array with a size that is equal to the given capacity

8
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,990
and returns.

9
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,170
A slice which refers to the underlying array.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:18,280
Generally, make function is used to create an entire slice here into slices on those slices that contain

11
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,840
a.re France.

12
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,840
You can see the syntax.

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,330
Then you use make function.

14
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,410
One option you have is to specify the length of this slice.

15
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,570
Then you just specify the length.

16
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,850
The capacity of the slice is the same.

17
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,480
Now go to this school to illustrate how to create a slice unique main function.

18
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:50,920
First, create PSNI's by Len four and capacity seven by make function for the example via the slice

19
00:01:51,610 --> 00:02:04,390
one equals make function first, set the tight end and set the land full and set the capacity.

20
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,260
Seven.

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:17,860
Now, display this nice warm weather, this nice one equal.

22
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:35,720
First, and the lower case and legislative lengths include first and De Palma backslash T and capacity

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:52,280
include first and the lower case brackets that end and sets the radiator first, slice one and then

24
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:03,500
land of its lifespan by the learned function land slice, warm and then capacity of this nice by the

25
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,760
function chat and set this list long.

26
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,600
And create this list by just Lin seven.

27
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:30,420
Go to the next line and create another slice that just slice two equals make function and type is in

28
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,190
length is seven.

29
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:48,130
Go to the next line and display this very area if if it's nice to equal first and the lower case back

30
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:55,130
is less tea length equal two percent.

31
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:09,050
The lower case come back is and check a city equal two percent the back end and sets the very idea a

32
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,330
slice too.

33
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,480
And length of this nice to by the function land.

34
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:29,540
This nice, too, and capacity of this guys to buy the phones and chat and set the slice.

35
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,740
If automatic to save the project and execute, they could.

36
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:46,510
Now we can see the output for this, like swan length is full and capacity is seven.

37
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,970
And for the lies, two lengths is set in and the capacities sit in.

38
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,480
It's nice is an abstraction over array.

39
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,710
It actually uses arrays as an underlying structure.

40
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,520
The land function returns the element present in their size, their chat function returns.

41
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,840
The capacity of this slice means how many elements it can accommodate in order not to prolong the time

42
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,630
of decision.

43
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,430
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

44
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,150
Goodbye.
