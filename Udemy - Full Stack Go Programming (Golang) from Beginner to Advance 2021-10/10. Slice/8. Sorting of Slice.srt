00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,800
Hello and welcome to the and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about modifying

2
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,990
it's nice and golden in this session, we want to talk about the others this last concept.

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,320
So think of a slice.

4
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:41,430
In go language, you are allowed to sort the L.A. present in this nice the standard library of GO languages

5
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,690
provides the sort haikus, which contains different types of sorting methods for sorting this noise

6
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,640
abuse floats, 64s and history.

7
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,080
These function always sorted and is available in this nice and ask ending order.

8
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:06,520
Now go to the school program to illustrate how to sew talent is present in this slice.

9
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,490
First, creating twist, nice variables.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:20,220
For example, a slice from Carlin equals S-Corp rocket and type is a strange and initialize value,

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,510
for the example.

12
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:22,720
Can.

13
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,060
Jehovah.

14
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,330
Go.

15
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,280
C++.

16
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:49,130
And the movie and in the next line, create another two slices slice to call and equals the school brackets,

17
00:01:49,190 --> 00:02:09,350
and Typekit is built and initialize values 30 twenty fifty nine to 10, 40, 80, 60 and 70 first displayed

18
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,000
as nice as before sorting.

19
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:22,010
Now do the following first print the message this p b for certain.

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,280
Go to the next line and display two variables.

21
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:35,690
Both P displays one and set the value in this nice form and go to the next line.

22
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,260
If they slice two

23
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,580
and set the value in a slice to reformat the code and save the project.

24
00:02:50,330 --> 00:03:00,590
Now performing sort operation on this slice using sort function, sort the art because type of first

25
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:12,950
this slice is a string we used strings function as strings and set the variable slice one and go to

26
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:19,910
the next line sort of dots because type of second, this nice is integer.

27
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,770
We use its function.

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,710
Hmm.

29
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:34,100
And I said that even it's nice to save the project and go to the next line and display a slices after

30
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,800
sorting them first display a message FP after.

31
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:51,410
So to go to the next line and display two variables if the this nice one

32
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,850
and go to the next line.

33
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:06,620
If the display is nice to consider, even it's nice to perform at could save the process and execute

34
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,280
the program.

35
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,950
Now we can see the output before sorting.

36
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:24,050
We have a nice one by the values per Java, Go, C++ and Ruby and Unsorted, and it's nice to 30 2015

37
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,780

38
09:30 10, 48 60 70.

39
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,450
And it is of to two.

40
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:38,450
After sorting, we have a nice volume by value C++ code Java, Perl, Ruby and so too, and it's nice

41
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:45,800
to have the values 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 and the values are sorted.

42
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:53,630
OK, we printed this slices and see the values are on sorted, so used from strings and Ian's function

43
00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:00,230
of social package and we could solve the slices in order not to prolong the time of decision.

44
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,350
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

45
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,780
Goodbye.
