00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,410
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,090
coffee one as nice items into another.

3
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,910
It's nice and golden in this session.

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,750
We want to talk about the others.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,810
It's nice this concept.

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:41,360
Append its lines to an existing disguise and go language, the uses of triple dot or ellipses used to

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,710
append a slice.

8
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:50,260
Now go to this good program to illustrate how to append this line to an existing is nice and go line

9
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:51,470
first.

10
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,940
Create with slices.

11
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:02,140
In this case, we define variables, by the way, that she walked by this nice one.

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,710
He calls it square brackets, Typekit string and assign values.

13
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:25,950
Java Sea Shore and Google go to the next line and define an event that it's nice to equals.

14
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:36,080
The square brackets Typekit string and initialize value curve and pitch.

15
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,800
Now, append is nice one, too.

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:58,120
It's nice to buy ellipses in append function is slice two equals append slice two and slice one by there.

17
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,310
Let's now go to the next line and display two slices.

18
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:15,200
First off, the slice one column comma slice one and go to the next line.

19
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,690
If B, it's nice to call in and separately, well, it's nice to.

20
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,130
Reformat the crew, save the project and execute the program.

21
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,450
Now we can see the output.

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,170
It's like one Java Sea Shark Go.

23
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,020
And it's nice to be Jawbone C-sharp Go.

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,260
We could copy as lies to existing as lies by append function and triple dot.

25
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,350
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

26
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,280
the next session.

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,060
Goodbye.
