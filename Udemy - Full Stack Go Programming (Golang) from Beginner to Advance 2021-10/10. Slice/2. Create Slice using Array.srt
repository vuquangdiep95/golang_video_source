00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,020
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,970
creative stories using this nicely try and indecision.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We want to talk about the other slices concept.

4
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,230
Create a slice using an array.

5
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,530
As beyond, and in no doubt, this lies is the reference of the NRA, so you can create this lines from

6
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,210
the given Harry for creating a sly spin on the given Harry.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,770
First, you need to specify the lower and upper bound, which means a slice can take elements from the

8
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,610
areas starting from the lower bound to the upper bound.

9
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:15,540
It does not include the elements about from the upper bound, as shown in the below syntax new lines.

10
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:23,210
Column equals calls add a name and Esquire brackets low column high.

11
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,830
These think tanks will return a new and slice.

12
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,870
The default value of the lower bound is zero and the default value of the upper bound is the total number

13
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,390
of the elements present in the given area.

14
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,630
Now go to be a good program to illustrate how to create the slices from the array first created at a

15
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,650
high rate.

16
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:56,720
Column he calls this group where I could sit five for the last and tight end and Inshallah is the value

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,070
on two, three, four and five.

18
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:09,500
Now we want to create some slices from the given at a first, create a slice by the vacuole.

19
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,050
Go to the next line for the example that is slice one.

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:30,590
He calls early S-Corp bracket one, Colleen two, and create either a slices by shorthand declaration

21
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:42,830
for the example slice two columns equals Rey high square bracket zero column.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:53,120
And in the next line, they slice three column equals a square bracket.

23
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,190
Column two.

24
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:06,590
And in the next line is slice for column equals every square brackets and set just column.

25
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:18,680
Now displayed, they created Annie and Slices by the following codes for the example RFP array.

26
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,140
Colin said the variable array

27
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,040
FP slice from Colin and said the variable as low as far

28
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:54,700
as close to column and slice two and displays a slice three, sets the variable slice three and pins

29
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:04,440
a slice for column and set the variable slice for save the project.

30
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,080
Now execute the code.

31
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,940
OK, we can see the output.

32
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:22,680
First, we print the created array, which contains the values one, two five and then a slice vong,

33
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:30,660
which is Thors, the first index of the array and contains the value to then a slice to each contains

34
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,640
the index zero to the end.

35
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,940
Nic stopped at eight and hold the values one to five.

36
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,080
Now Slice three, which contains the zero index of the array to the second index and holds the value

37
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,950
von N2.

38
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,440
And finally, the force is nice that holds all the values of the ADI and we could define the slices

39
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,850
using array.

40
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,100
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

41
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,970
the next session.

42
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,570
Goodbye.
