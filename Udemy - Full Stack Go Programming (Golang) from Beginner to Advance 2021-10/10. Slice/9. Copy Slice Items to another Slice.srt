00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,350
Hello and welcome to the and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about sorting

2
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,150
of a slice.

3
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,600
And in this session, we want to talk about the authors.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,830
It's nice concepts.

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:36,790
Copy one is those items into another, it's nice and golden, it built in copy function is used to copy

6
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,770
data from one it's nice to one another.

7
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:46,890
Now, go to this good program to illustrate how to copy one of those items into another slice.

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:56,550
First, create a smaller slice and initialize it for the example, a column he calls square brackets.

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,480
Time is gained and initialize value by 10, 20 and 30.

10
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,420
Go to the next night and this display, even if he is less.

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:20,410
He can set the variable in a and go to the next line display length and capacity of a value that if

12
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:31,740
there is a slice, a length is persons D and

13
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:45,750
the column first, then the back is less an opening and display the length and capacity of variable

14
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:58,800
eight by two functions Len and Jack lend a hand, share the reform and save the projects.

15
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:08,220
Now create a bigger slice, then offer a slice we use from make function to create is nice b and don't

16
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:18,630
initialize it for the example B column equals make function and type is aimed at length is five and

17
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,810
capacity is ten and don't assign any values to be evaluated.

18
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:36,750
Now go to next line and use copy function for copy s noise eight inside a slice b copy and B Command

19
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,760
A Now go to the next line and display variable B after copy.

20
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,220
It's nice.

21
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,560
18.

22
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:56,850
Say this nice b if he hits Slice B B and go to the next line and display length and capacity of value

23
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:15,570
to be f f is nice the length per cent d and capacity column person D.

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,240
And displayed the length and capacity of many will be by two functions lane and chat.

25
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:35,460
Then B. and Shad be reformed to quote, save the project and execute the program.

26
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,020
Now we can see the output for Nice A.

27
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,840
The values are 10 to 30.

28
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,750
And length is three and capacity is three.

29
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,910
And then we defined variable without initialize the value and copy a inside B and it's nice.

30
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,430
B have the values 10, 20, 30 and length is five and capacities 10.

31
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:07,660
Now we could copy one as nice items into another slice and go golden in order not to prolong the time

32
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,440
of decision.

33
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,220
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

34
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:12,790
Goodbye.
