00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,140
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,170
at iTunes Twist Nice using app and function.

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,220
In this session, we want to talk about the authors.

4
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,370
It's nice concepts.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,230
Modifying your slides and go like.

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,430
As we already know, that is a nice reference point.

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,520
It can refer an underlying era.

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,140
So if we change some elements in this noise, then the changes should also take place in the referenced

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,330
era or in other wars.

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,970
If you made any changes in this line, then it will also reflect in the array.

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,690
Now, go to the Scott program to illustrate how to modifying this slice.

12
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:16,080
First, create an area for the exemption, and a call in equals the square bracket and said six value

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:26,430
for land type is eight and initialize value 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60.

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,820
Now create this list from this Eric.

15
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,780
Go to the next line and slice sovereign equals ray.

16
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:48,220
This global markets lower bond and offer bond for the example, zero, Colin, for now, we print elements

17
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,540
of area and this long as before modifying go to the next line.

18
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,280
And if the

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,170
first and only

20
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:11,290
certain area that I go to, the next one is the first slice.

21
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:23,520
And said the very idea the slice said the project, now we want to modify three elements of a slice

22
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,260
do the following.

23
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:36,690
For example, the Slice Index zero said the value the 100 go to the next line.

24
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:48,720
The Slice Index one set the value 200 and go to the next line and slice.

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:03:00,330
Index to initialize value by the 300, now go to the next line and display elements of Adi and his thoughts

26
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:16,960
after modifying the brackets list and second Ray and said How do you rate it and go to the next line?

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:31,290
If the second slice and certainly even a slice reformat the code, save the projects and execute the

28
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,710
code.

29
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:42,430
Now we can see the output first at a values are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

30
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,020
And first the slice is 10, 20, 30 and 40.

31
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:55,120
After modifying second at A has the values 100, 200, 300 and 40 50 60.

32
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,580
And the second, this list has values 100, 200, 300 and 40.

33
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,820
Now we change the elements of this lies.

34
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,270
And so that the elements in the array also changed.

35
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,450
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

36
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,360
the next session.

37
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,790
Goodbye.
