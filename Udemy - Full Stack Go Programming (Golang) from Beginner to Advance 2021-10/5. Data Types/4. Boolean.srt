00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,730
Hello and welcome to Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,280
In the previous session, we talked about complex numbers and indecision.

3
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,640
We want to talk about the others data types concept.

4
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:39,890
Billions, the Boolean data type represents only one bit of information, either true or false, and

5
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,850
is defined as bold when declaring it as a data.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,410
The values of type Boolean are not converted implicitly or explicitly to any other type.

7
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,410
Default value for bold is false.

8
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,590
Now let's go to your school program and illustrate how to use off billions.

9
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,720
First, we'd be fine tuning variables by issue time and assign values to them.

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:16,680
So the right is TR one column equals and initialize it by the Value Gold program.

11
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,400
Go to the next line and define another variable light as the are to call, and he calls and initialize

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,780
it by all characters uppercase go through pro range.

13
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,460
OK.

14
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:42,310
Go to the next line and define another variable like is TR tree calling equals and initialize it by

15
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,700
value.

16
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,360
Lite value of SDR won't go through your own.

17
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:59,080
OK, now you want to compare the values of the two variables SDR one and SDR two, and put the result

18
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,340
of their value equal or unequal inside the result one variable.

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,200
So go to the next line and define another variable like resolved.

20
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:15,700
One call in equals SDR one equal equal SDR to.

21
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:25,800
If the values of these two variables are equal to each other, the value of truth is assigned to the

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,120
result one variable.

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,240
Otherwise, the value of funds is assigned to it.

24
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,850
We also do this competition for the two variables SDR one and SDR three, and put the value in result

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,690
to variable.

26
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:49,950
So go to the next line and define another variable like resolved two column equals SDR one equal equal

27
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,900
to SDR treat.

28
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,580
Now display the values of result variables sold, right, FP.

29
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,860
Resolved, one caller resolved one.

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,850
Go to the next line, F.B..

31
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:21,660
Resolved to call and resolve to and go to the next line and display type of these variables.

32
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,100
So be right if Earth time are resolved.

33
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:45,930
One caller person, Theodorakis, resolved one and set it back his classroom and if tie all resolved

34
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,550
blue collar person, he and said, resolved to.

35
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,420
OK.

36
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,420
Reformat the court, save the project and execute the program.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,820
Now run the comment, go round the back.

38
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,390
Is this mean that go?

39
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:15,690
Now we can see the output resolved, one is false and result, too is true and type of result one in

40
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,340
result two is bold.

41
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:24,450
OK, we could define Boolean variable and initialize them in order not to prolong the time of decision.

42
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,080
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

43
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:28,860
Goodbye.
