00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,220
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course.

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,430
In the previous session, we talked about brilliance.

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,960
And in this session, we want to talk about the other data types concept.

4
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:40,130
Strings in go language strings can be seen as a collection of characters, we can be of length one one

5
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,700
character.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,340
But it's usually longer as string is always written in double quotes.

7
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,740
Now you can see the syntax.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:58,250
So this string data type represents a sequence of Unicode code points or in other words, we can say

9
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:04,580
string is a sequence of immutable bytes means Vanessa String is created.

10
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,410
You cannot change.

11
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:14,870
That is string is string may contain arbitrary data, including bytes with zero value in the human Griddy.

12
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:22,490
But for now, let's go to the school program to illustrate how to use this string.

13
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,090
First, define a variable, which is those strings used from short declaration.

14
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,690
So the right SDR column equals and initialize it by GO.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,910
True crime means.

16
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,290
Thank.

17
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,390
And go to the next line.

18
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:56,000
In this case, you want to display the value of SDR, so you're right, if the value of this TR color

19
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:04,640
percent is lowered case because the type of stories assuming we use from percent as lowercase as formatted

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,060
string and we said SDR.

21
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,640
Go to the next line and display type of the variable.

22
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,900
So be right if if the tongue is still on.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,980
Column per cent t upper case, and we said, OK, here we want to display the length of the string.

24
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:40,110
So use from limb function, the limb function gets the string as argument and returns the length of

25
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,640
the string as integer.

26
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,140
So go to the next line and write as if.

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:59,680
The land all is the Colin Person D, because return type of limb function is integers, so we use from

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:08,470
person to ask for more testing and calling lend function and sit is serious argument to it.

29
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,530
Put it back as less and end of each line for go to a new line,

30
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,270
reformat the code, save the project and execute the program by running the common goal.

31
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,170
The does this mean that go now we can see the output.

32
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,570
The value of SDR is go programming language.

33
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:41,380
The type of SDR is history and the length of history is 23 due to the importance of history.

34
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,100
This topic will be fully explored in future chapters.

35
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,650
OK, we have reached the end of this session.

36
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,300
I hope you take full advantage of this session onto next session.

37
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,850
Goodbye.
