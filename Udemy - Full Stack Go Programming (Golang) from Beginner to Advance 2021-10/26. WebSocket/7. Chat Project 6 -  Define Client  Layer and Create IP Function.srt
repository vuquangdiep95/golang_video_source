00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,810
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:24,040
We were able to implement the silver layer, and in this session we want to implement the client layer.

3
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:36,780
So go to Package Expeller and go to website, get folder and create a folder name like Cloudflare Client

4
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,830
Layer and inside it.

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,830
Create the file name like client that go layer.

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,180
Go

7
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,580
now, set the package name package.

8
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,690
Main.

9
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:06,520
OK, in this file, we have to do the things related to setting up the client and client needs to connect

10
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,270
to the server.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:16,210
So define a main method if the first client must communicate with the server.

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,430
To do this, we call the dial function from the vets to get package.

13
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,440
The function opens a new client connection to a verb subject.

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:34,770
This function accepts through our unions and return to values first, connection and second and then

15
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,030
all.

16
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:42,760
So first define to variable like connection and error connection comma error.

17
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,360
Column equals that suggests.

18
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,590
Don't go off.

19
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:06,530
First argument is a silver address that in this case, it is localhost and we defined a 85 port for

20
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:14,630
it when we use events to get our protocol is not issued DP type, but it is a double US type.

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:27,680
So we write double quotation marks the Avenue S Column S slash 127.0.0.1 as localhost

22
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,370
column 885 as Port No.

23
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,700
The second argument is specifies the time of port.

24
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,610
Of course, this argument is set when the type of protocol is not as specified in the address.

25
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,910
And since we specified the time of port going into your head, we no longer need to set this argument.

26
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,030
So set a double quotation marks.

27
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:11,030
And third, human requires us to have an origin where we send the IP class as the origin to the function.

28
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:18,050
So we have to implement a method to create the IP client, for example, create the function named like

29
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,700
create IP, create IP.

30
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,920
So go out of this function and implement the create IP method.

31
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:44,000
This function suppose to return estimated value values so we define farm, create IP and return type

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,080
is estranged.

33
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,110
Now you should create an IEP, since IEP consists of four parts.

34
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,160
We need to create a four element at eight by the end type.

35
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:07,010
So we write that IEP for by the Typekit.

36
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:17,600
Now we want to initialize daddy for do this using end end function from the Randt package, we assign

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,380
the random number between zero and two hundred and fifty six to each of the three cells created.

38
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,700
We do this through a follow up to number of the adding members.

39
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,860
It is for forces to set the ADI, so we write for

40
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,290
I call an equals zero I less than

41
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,770
lenn of array and I + +.

42
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,760
In order for the generated number not to be the same, he is the seat function from the and package

43
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:07,190
seat function uses the provided seat value to initialize the default source to a deterministic estate

44
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,660
and Connie now function of time packaged as argument for it.

45
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,850
So the ride ran don't seat

46
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,040
and calling now function from time package time.

47
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,910
Don't now, don't you need now.

48
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,750
Now, right.

49
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:54,210
IP index AI equals cunning int in function of Rand Packer's Rand Darts end in fonctionne and set two

50
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,390
hundred and fifty six as argument for it.

51
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,610
Two hundred and fifty six.

52
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:12,350
Now we create and return IP using the Sprint F function from the FMD package, so we right return T

53
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,090
dot a screen test.

54
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,420
TTP.

55
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,720
Column ss ss.

56
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,930
Person to person, to person to person.

57
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:31,990
The

58
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:48,640
Ansip IPA adding elements as all human for this method IPA Index zero for First Element IP Index, one

59
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:59,710
for second variable IP Index, two for Third Element and IP Index today for Forced Element.

60
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:07,570
Now we could define create IP function in order not to prolong the time of the session.

61
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,260
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

62
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:11,950
Goodbye.
