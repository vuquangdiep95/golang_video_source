00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,090
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous sessions.

2
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,770
We were able to implement this sorted server and client layers.

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,860
Now it's time to run the project.

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:32,780
It's is important to note that the server layer and the circuit layer must be executed seamlessly.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,100
To do this, enter to the terminal and execute the following comment.

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,750
So time go run first.

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:53,120
Go to server that Google server layer server that go and comment gets wet and go to the socket that

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,800
Google Socket surgical and present.

9
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,560
OK, now server is right.

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,550
We need to execute the client layer for this purpose.

11
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,190
We use two separate terminals to execute the client and server methods.

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:21,410
To do this, right click on the client that go and select Revel in File Explorer.

13
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,290
In the window that opens, hold down the shift key and right click and select Open PowerShell window.

14
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,170
Now in new policy terminal opens for us.

15
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:47,630
Hold down the shift key inside the same page again, right click and select Open PowerShell window here

16
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,200
again.

17
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,910
Reassigned the tool, confirming those inside their screens so we can see both at the same time.

18
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,320
First term in the second term.

19
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,000
Also in the window that opens open the index file by double clicking on it.

20
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:22,980
Okay.

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,680
Raises these broader.

22
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,380
Much.

23
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:52,290
Now we use this command with some communication between client and server in each client, in publisher

24
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,130
in.

25
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:09,700
Go round the back slash client, go first terminal is running and go to second terminal and do this

26
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,630
command again.

27
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,880
Go round.

28
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,120
The back is last line that go.

29
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,780
And second terminal is running now.

30
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,740
It is important to note that first the server and socket must be started and then the client file must

31
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,570
be a start after its execution.

32
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,540
We now have three clients running to clients in two separate terminals.

33
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,250
And one client on the web.

34
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,270
It's time to exchange data and messages between them.

35
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,650
Once sent the message from each client to the server, the sent message must be visible on all planes.

36
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,430
For example, we sent the Hello message in first time in our.

37
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,050
Hello.

38
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,640
OK.

39
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:08,990
Now we see that this message is seen in other clients first terminal, second terminal and Prosor.

40
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,630
And they do the same from another client, for example, in the second terminal.

41
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:23,870
We send the welcome message Well, come OK.

42
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,260
We see that this message is also visible to other clients.

43
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,810
And now we want to send the message from our client.

44
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,510
For example, we said goodbye.

45
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,090
Send data.

46
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,520
OK.

47
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,000
We see that the message sent is visible to our clients.

48
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,380
OK.

49
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:56,220
In this session, we were able to implement the simple chat program using David Sujit and go like we

50
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,830
have reached end of decision.

51
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,870
I hope you have take full advantage of this decision.

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,740
Goodbye.
