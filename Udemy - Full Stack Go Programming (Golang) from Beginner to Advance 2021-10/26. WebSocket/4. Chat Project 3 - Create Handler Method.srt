00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,960
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course in the preview session.

2
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,280
We could define methods for implementing channels.

3
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,570
Indecision.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,410
Finally, we will define our handler that we listen to the events of the channels.

5
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,780
The Loop keeps running infinitely and said it's the appropriate action based on the channel's event.

6
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,700
So we designed in metal to control this behavior named like wrong socket.

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:57,600
So we right fine set a receiver like config pointer of config

8
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,670
run socket.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,160
And create a loop as a permanent listener for.

10
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:27,990
Now we manage the channel's behavior using the select comment, but different cases, so we try to select

11
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,140
and define our cases earlier.

12
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,230
We implemented a few methods for different channel behaviors that we will now use from them.

13
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,460
For example, suppose data is transferred to the registered land channel to implement it.

14
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:55,110
To the following case Set a name register

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,970
client colony equals send data to channel.

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,970
Config

17
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:21,040
dot register client now icon the corresponding method for each case in this case, for the registered

18
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,830
client chase.

19
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:37,430
The invoking registered line methods saw the right config dot register clients and set registered client

20
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,990
as argument for it, alleges the client.

21
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,050
Okay, now right case related to remove client

22
00:02:52,130 --> 00:03:08,090
JS set and name like remove client calling E calls and send data to channel config dot.

23
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,370
Remove client calling and calling.

24
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,170
Now remove Client Smith for this case.

25
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,520
Config dot remove clients.

26
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,160
And said Ring of Clinton's argument for this method to remove plans.

27
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:48,710
And right Chase related to Message Exchange set a name like message data, message data he calls send

28
00:03:48,710 --> 00:04:01,550
data to channel config, that message data caller and colleague message data's method for this case

29
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:13,780
config dot message data for it and set message data as argument for this message date.

30
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,400
Reformat the code and save the project.

31
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,420
Now you were able to manage channels control using Select.

32
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,340
In this case, we could make all the configuration for implementing the circuit layer in order not to

33
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,900
prolong the time of decision.

34
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,190
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

35
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:40,910
Goodbye.
