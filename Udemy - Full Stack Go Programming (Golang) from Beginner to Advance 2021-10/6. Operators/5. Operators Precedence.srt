00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,410
Panel and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,500
logical operators and in decision, we want to talk about the other operators concept.

3
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,180
Operators, presidents operate or presidents determines the grouping of turns in an expedition.

4
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,960
This affects how an expedition is evaluated.

5
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,850
Certain operators have higher precedence than others.

6
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:55,860
For example, the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the Edicion operator here.

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,900
Operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table.

8
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,700
Those with the lowest appear at the bottom within an expertise in higher precedence.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,330
Operators will be evaluated first.

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,980
Now let's go to the school curriculum to illustrate how to use operators precedence.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,820
First, we define a variable and initialize it by an expedition.

12
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:33,510
For example, we define a variable like X calling equal and initialize it by seven plus three multiplication.

13
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,330
Two now display the output by the following comment.

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,750
So we write that if.

15
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,380
Resolve.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,170
Paula, Person, D. and Sir, it's very, very.

17
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,230
Reformat the court, save the project and execute the program.

18
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,600
Now we can see the output result is 13 here.

19
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:11,930
Each is assigned 13, not 20, because operator multiplication has hired a pittance that operator plus.

20
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,090
So it first gets multiplied with three multiplication too.

21
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,680
And the result is six and then six value adds into seven.

22
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,230
And final result is 13.

23
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,300
OK.

24
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,490
We were able to explain operators precedence and go language and give examples.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,010
We have reached the end of decision session.

26
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,070
I hope you take full advantage of this session until next session.

27
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,660
Goodbye.
