00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,950
Hello and welcome to the and programming language course in the preview session, we talked about competition

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,430
operators and indecision.

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,730
We want to talk about the other operators concept.

4
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:40,240
Logical operators, logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

5
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:48,130
They are used to combine two or more conditions or constraints or to complement the evaluation of the

6
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,320
original condition in consideration.

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:01,150
Logical operators and go length are logical and logical, old and logical nuts.

8
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,820
Now let's go to this quote.

9
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,480
Bring it on to illustrate how to use logical operators.

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:19,990
First, define three variables and initialize them, for example, via X Common Y Z and initialize by

11
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,490
the values 100, 200 and 300.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
In the first case, we want to check logical and operator.

13
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,450
So the right FP

14
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:47,890
x less than y logical and x unitard then z because we use phenomenological and operator returns.

15
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:55,270
True value if both statements are true, means x less than Y is true and x greater downs.

16
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:03,190
It is true and we know that if the answer of any statement is false, final result will be false.

17
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,260
Now save the project and go to turn on and execute the program.

18
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:15,090
So, Ron, the and go right back, is this mean that good?

19
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,560
Now we can see the output.

20
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,170
The result is false.

21
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,710
In the first section, we want to check your weather is the variable.

22
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:34,860
It's less than the variable y or not, which means weather is a hundred less than 200 and the result

23
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,400
is true.

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,570
And in the next session, we want to check whether is the variable is greater than the variable that

25
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,490
or not, which means weather is 100 greater than 300 or not.

26
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,290
And the result is false.

27
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,700
So the logical and operator between true and false returns false value.

28
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,390
In the second case, we want to check logical or operator.

29
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,910
So first clear, last cold.

30
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,730
So tried FP.

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:29,830
X less than y logical or even greater than that, because we from logical all operate all return through

32
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:36,550
value, if both statements are true and we know that if the answer of any statement is true, final

33
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,690
result will be true.

34
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,380
So save the project and execute the program.

35
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,790
So be right.

36
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,650
Go wrong.

37
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,840
Beck is left me that go in the first section.

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,350
We want to check whether is the variable that less than the variable y or not, which means Vector is

39
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,710
100 less than 200 and the result is true.

40
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:06,970
And in the next session, we want to check whether is the variable is greater than the variable Z or

41
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,450
not, which means Vector is 100 greater than 300 or not, and the result is false.

42
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:21,010
So the logical or operator between true and false return, true value term case.

43
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,470
In this case, if you want to check logical not so first year the last quote.

44
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,710
Right.

45
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:37,690
Iffy, logical, not open and close Francis's.

46
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,060
Is equal to y logical and.

47
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,460
It's greater than that.

48
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,680
OK.

49
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:58,520
Because we use from logic and not operate or reverse the result returns false if the result is true

50
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,610
or returns true if the result is false.

51
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,410
So we they could save the project and execute the program.

52
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,150
Now we can see the output result is true in the first section.

53
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:23,390
We want to check whether is the variable X equal to Y or not, which means whether is 100 equals 200

54
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,100
and the result is false.

55
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,370
And in the next section, we want to check whether is the variable is greater than the variable is it

56
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,500
or not, which means whether is 100 greater than 300 or not.

57
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,180
And the result is false.

58
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:47,230
So the logical and operator between false and false return, false value and logical not to play true

59
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,560
false value is true.

60
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,810
So the final result is true.

61
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:58,970
Okay, we were able to explain the definition of logical operators and give examples in order not to

62
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,420
prolong the time of decision.

63
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,130
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

64
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,790
Goodbye.
