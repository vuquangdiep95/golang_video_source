00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:20,750
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, you talked about

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,190
arithmetic operators.

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,020
And in this session, we want to talk about the other operators concept.

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,490
Assignment operators, assignment operators are used to assigning a value to a variable.

5
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:47,650
The left side or brand of the assignment operator is a variable and right site or plan of the assignment

6
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,970
operator is the value.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,230
The value on the right side must be of the same data type of the variable on the left side.

8
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:05,680
Otherwise, the compiler will raise an array of assignment operators and go languages are simple assignment

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,020
operator, add and assignment operator.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,100
Subtract and assignment operator.

11
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,790
Multiply and assignment operator.

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,440
Divide and assignment operator.

13
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,170
And Modulus and assignment operator.

14
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,650
Now let's go to your school program to illustrate how to use of assignment operators.

15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,290
First, we define two variables and initialize them.

16
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:46,760
For example, that a Boyda type eight equals 30 and Vice B by the time gained and equals 15.

17
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,780
Now create the Sampat for simple assignment operator.

18
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,970
Now we will write a equals b.

19
00:01:59,490 --> 00:01:59,940
OK.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,050
A variable value is equivalent be variable value.

21
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:14,250
Now go to the next line and disbelief values are variable A and B, so the right f be a equals, said

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,790
Avery.

23
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:26,580
Then I go to the next line FP B equals comma B, so reformat the code, save the project and execute

24
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,300
the program.

25
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,550
Go wrong dot.

26
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,630
This list may just go.

27
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,900
Now we can see the output A equals one.

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,380
B equals 50, so a variable value is equivalent B variable value.

29
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,540
Now create the same pin for add and assignment operator.

30
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,850
So first, clear the last code.

31
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,280
So we write a plus equals B.

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,270
It adds right or end to the left or print and assign a result to left or print.

33
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,690
It means a equals a plus b.

34
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:15,450
Now we display the value of a variable, so we write FP A equals a.

35
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:24,310
Save the project and execute the program first, clear screen, go run, dot back as main the school.

36
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:36,530
Now we can see the output, a variable value is equivalent, the sum of variable A and B, and it is

37
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,770
80 now create a sample for subtract and assignment operator.

38
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:49,490
So first clear the last court a minus equals B.

39
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,300
It's soft strikes, right or planned from the left or planned and assigned the reason to lift or print,

40
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,790
it means a equals a minus B.

41
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:11,870
Now we display the value of a variable, so we write up a equals comma, a save the project and execute

42
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,590
the program.

43
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,350
Now we can see the output.

44
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:27,260
A variable value is equivalent to subtraction of variables A and B, and it's equals minus 20.

45
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,570
Now create a sample for multiply and assignment operator.

46
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,030
So clear the last quote.

47
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,040
A multiplication equals B.

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,200
It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left footprint.

49
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,340
It means a equals a multiplication.

50
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,930
B Now go to the next line and display the value of a value.

51
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:08,040
So we write up a equals comma, a save the project and execute the program.

52
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:20,760
Now we can see the output a equals one thousand and 500, a variable value is equivalent to the multiplication

53
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,680
of variables A and B.

54
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,390
Now you want to create a sample for divide and assignment operator.

55
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,700
So first clear the last code

56
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:44,080
and we write a divide equals be it divided left operand with the right operation and assign the result

57
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,120
to left operand.

58
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,670
It means eight equals eight.

59
00:05:47,670 --> 00:06:00,360
Division B now go to the next line and display the value of a variable, so we write f b e equals comma

60
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,580
a save the project, then execute the program.

61
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:17,770
Now we can see the output a equals zero, the value of the variable A is equal to the division of the

62
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,310
value that a buy B and it's zero.

63
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:32,280
Now, create a sample for modules and assignment operator sofas clear the last got a.

64
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,570
Modulus.

65
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,680
Equals B.

66
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:47,630
It takes modulus using two operations and assigns the result left operand, and it's means a equals

67
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:57,800
a modulus b now go to the next line and display the value of a valid and so great FP a equals comma

68
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,670
a.

69
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,310
Reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

70
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:16,570
Now we can see the output eight equals 13, the value of variable A is equal to the reminder of the

71
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,340
division of Variable A by B, and it's 30.

72
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,750
OK.

73
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,530
We were able to explain the assignment operators and give examples in order not to prolong the time

74
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,310
of decision.

75
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,150
We will finish it and we'll continue the content in the next session.

76
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,840
Goodbye.
