00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,530
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,820
In the previous session, we could define the function name G.R. PC server initialize or to initialize

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:30,290
the DB connection field of the G.R. PC controller struct and using it in this session, it's time to

4
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,570
implement the Jarvis's server methods.

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,490
If you remember in our profile, we create messages and services related to G.R. PC.

6
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:47,540
Then we compiled our existing profile and created the equivalent profile in gold language.

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,200
Now it's time to implement the metals in the proto file and go blank in the JROTC series.

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,290
For this purpose, we go to define created from our compile profile.

9
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:08,840
So go to Project folder and go to a protocol folder and open a student on the RISCOS your PC that he

10
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,320
did not go okay.

11
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:20,870
These functions are located in the student service server interface and the open defined box by press

12
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,710
cards for F and type service server.

13
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:39,040
OK, now we can see two implemented functions in the port of fine carpet, these two functions and transfer

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,400
them to our G.P.S. service and implement them.

15
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,010
Copy these files.

16
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,210
And go to service controller.

17
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,520
One is the get a student by either method, which takes students either as a parameter and returns the

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,710
complete information of that student.

19
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:19,110
And another is they get the students by name, which receives name as the input parameter and fits all

20
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,800
the students whose names are equal to the input parameters.

21
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,480
Now go to implement this function for the jihadist control strike.

22
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,090
Let's start with the get the student by I.D. function, so we right fine

23
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:44,280
set a variable like server by the time GOPAC controller as implements the function server

24
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,510
and asterisk G.R. PC controller.

25
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:01,710
Get a student by idea and set a variable for context like context.

26
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:13,780
And set the value of a light idea to point the search by item message from protocol package IED.

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,210
And sits asterisk.

28
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,700
And that particular.

29
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,490
Oh, it's huge.

30
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,030
Why?

31
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,670
And set return times first is teasing this strike from political package that created in GOP support

32
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,630
to fine.

33
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:57,770
Asterisk, plural, to quote art students and said their hopes, their method was created.

34
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:04,570
Now we have to implement its body by calling the server object from the GOP controller a strong.

35
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,410
It has access to the DB connection field through which we can con the get a student by either the method

36
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,360
that accept an I.D. as input parameter and return to values.

37
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,760
First, the student information whose IDE is equal to the input from the third and second values.

38
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,590
And therefore so we defined two variables like a student

39
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:40,390
and error column equals set server, object server and call DB connection object, DB connection object.

40
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,990
And it will give the student based ID get the student base, i.e. the function and can't get I.D. function

41
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,150
from the service by either message.

42
00:04:52,150 --> 00:05:03,760
By calling either variable i.e. did get idea kick error status if they're not equals, nil

43
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,250
return mean and error

44
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,500
and return values for this function student.

45
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,320
And need.

46
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,830
But we see that our method has an error and does not accept this student and return value.

47
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,080
The answer is all of us.

48
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:46,510
The reason for the error is that the return value of the select a student base I deem at all is a student

49
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,770
of the model package.

50
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:56,440
But the return value of the gift a student by either method is a student from the portal to PHI.

51
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,940
So we have to create the function to convert a model, a student to a pro to find a student.

52
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,170
So we write.

53
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,840
Fonts

54
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,670
convert to G PC.

55
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,900
The student sit a student from model package as input parameter.

56
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,850
A student

57
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,810
from model package model the student.

58
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:49,740
And sit a student as return tie from Portrait of My Soul, right, asterisk protocol.

59
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,470
The arts students

60
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,610
now return as student objects from protocol package and initialize it by the student values from model

61
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:11,190
pichay silver right, return ampersand protocol.

62
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:28,730
A student and initialize the field of this I.D. equals the student ID and name equals student's name

63
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:37,820
and age equals the student, but each reformat the code and saved the project.

64
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:48,350
So we were able to create the function to get an instance a student of the model package and convert

65
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,220
it to a student of p0.05.

66
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,900
Now go to the get a student by either method and use this function for convert the student instance.

67
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,500
So clear the error code.

68
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:15,170
And return Colin Koehler to jobs student function and set a student as input parameter for converter

69
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:29,180
protocol as students convert to a job as a student and sit as a student and sit near, reformat the

70
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:38,600
code and save the project and we don't have any or OK now we could implement get a student by either

71
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:45,550
method, which receives an idea as the input parameter and returns the student who has that idea.

72
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:51,110
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

73
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,010
the next session.

74
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,700
Goodbye.
