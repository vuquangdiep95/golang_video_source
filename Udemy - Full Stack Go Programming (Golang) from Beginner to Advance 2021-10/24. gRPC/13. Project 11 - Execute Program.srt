00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,380
Hello and welcome to the Go programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:24,210
We were able to implement the Ron GOPAC server and run GOPAC client functions and indecision.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,110
We want to run the program for this purpose.

4
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,580
We use two separate terminals to execute the client and server methods.

5
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,290
To do this, right click on the one off the package of the project folder and select the Rilwan Ford

6
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,830
Explorer.

7
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,000
For the example, right click on the main package.

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,270
And select Ribbon in foreign experience.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,760
In the window that opens, hold down the shift key and right click and select the open PowerShell option.

10
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,970
Now, a new PowerShell terminal opens for us and do this again.

11
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:20,970
Now, another terminal opens for us, reassigning the two open terminals inside the skin so we can see

12
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,680
both at the same time.

13
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:50,910
Now we use this command to run our program once we the surf league and once we the client flat for the

14
00:01:50,910 --> 00:02:06,450
server, we write, go wrong, go to main package and Maine that go Fong Dash admin server.

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:20,570
Now we can see the server is running and go to another terminal and wrong clients, right?

16
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:28,900
Go run, go to package main and main that go find Dash.

17
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,030
That means by the flag clients and run

18
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,880
when you run the client side program, we are asked which option you want to select.

19
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,470
There are two options.

20
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,230
Number one and number two in option number one based on the name.

21
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:58,510
It is supposed to show us the least of all students in the database that have that name and in option

22
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,000
number two based on an I.D. number.

23
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,190
Displays the student information whose ID is equal to the number received.

24
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,070
For example, we want to select number one.

25
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,620
So right one and press enter.

26
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:24,400
For example, we enter the name David and press enter date after entering the name David.

27
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,520
The program will show us the list of S2.

28
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,830
Then whose name is David?

29
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,540
Once again, we do this on there.

30
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,330
Another name?

31
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:52,130
Select one and press enter now into another name for exemption, Jack,

32
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,530
and we can see the program is show off the list of a student whose name is Jack.

33
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:06,050
Once again, Rod declared side program and in this time, select the number two.

34
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:21,690
Select number two and trace, either in this case, we are asked to enter an I.D. number.

35
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:31,500
For example, we enter five for I.D. value on press enter after entering the I.D. by the five value

36
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,450
the program is shown, the student information whose idea is equal to number five do a gain.

37
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:57,250
Select number two and enter your I.D. for the exam, press three and enter now we can see I.D. equals

38
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,550
three named David and Age Terrifying.

39
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:08,590
In this tutorial, we succeed to implement a G.R. piece of service based using protocol partner, and

40
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:15,820
we were able to connect to the database through the G.R. PC service and run our queries on it.

41
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,660
First, we created the part related to the database.

42
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,410
Then we launched our job jobs a service, and then we designed the methods related to the server and

43
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,560
client part and established their connection with the job service and the database.

44
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,830
We have reached end of decision.

45
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,080
I hope you have taken full advantage of this session until next session.

46
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:41,860
Goodbye.
