1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,360
Headline welcome to the Golang programming language course in the previous session, we could define

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:25,470
the function name, select a student based idea, and in this session we want to create the function

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,940
to select all the students based the given name by sending a name to the database as the input parameter

4
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,170
of the select metal and all returning list of the students whose name is the same as the value sent.

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,830
So go to define this function.

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,300
Find set receiver for me to be assigned this method and the DB initialize arrested I.

7
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,290
So we write DB initialize or.

8
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,360
And the type is asked to resolve any.

9
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:20,470
Initialize the defined name of Method, select its Hugh Downs based name and define input parameter.

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,280
This method accept string value as name variable because it will return list of a student based name.

11
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:34,600
Name is strange and return type is two values first array.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:45,370
All the students object, and second is an error value, so the right slice might allow a student in

13
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,040
error.

14
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:54,880
Now go to implement the body of function now by calling the DB initialize the value that we will have

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,510
access to the DB object from the strength of school package.

16
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:04,510
And through it, we can call the query method and executes the returns rolls.

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,430
Typically, as select, the arguments are for any placeholder parameter in the query query function

18
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:20,830
accepts estriol queries, statement as a strict parameter and returns to rows and URL object, so define

19
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,150
tool variable like roles and all roles.

20
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,280
And they're all calling.

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:42,030
He calls DV Initialize or dot and Dot query in this query.

22
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,540
We want to fetch list of students information whose name we have sent to the database as a query input

23
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,130
from her.

24
00:02:48,140 --> 00:03:02,240
So we write select a song from the students their name equals, so the quotation marks and Sydney variable

25
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,290
as input value.

26
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,060
Now check entries.

27
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:14,480
That was so we right if they're not equals mean lot fattore.

28
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,990
That's her function.

29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,520
OK?

30
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:28,650
One of the returned values of our mettle is a list of students, so we create an array of student etc.

31
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:35,400
to add to each new student that is read from the database, from the student data and at the end of

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,540
fetching data from the database, the students area is returned by the function.

33
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:52,810
So we write this to this column, equal area of modern dance students now put the return value of the

34
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,210
quality inside of Falou to access each of the rows by the next function.

35
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:11,470
So the wry blue rolls darts next function next function prepares the next result to roll for Reading

36
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,490
V desk and metal.

37
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,420
It returns true on success or false.

38
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,850
If there is no next is on a roll or an error happened while preparing it.

39
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,430
So we create an object from a student.

40
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,580
A strong student, Colleen equals model both a student

41
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,160
and colleague.

42
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,970
Eskin method on Rolls Resort to read recalls one by one.

43
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,120
Scan copies the columns in the car and throw into the various points that by destination.

44
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,750
The number of values in destination must be the same as the number of columns and rows defined, and

45
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,270
everybody invokes scan function.

46
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:09,160
Error equals rows dots function sit a student ideas point two percent The student thought ID

47
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:21,070
and sit a student name is going to ampersand student's name and set.

48
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:31,360
The student age is going to understand student age, Eskin Commerce, Collins read from the database

49
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,270
into defining common goal times in the special.

50
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:49,850
Times were white, but the school case, so check ED over status if or not equals mean sits log dot,

51
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:57,970
fattore or dot roll and continue.

52
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,130
Now we at each read record that contains a student to the list of the students by the append function

53
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,410
to append built in function at pins elements to the end of each slice.

54
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:27,490
So we write students equals happened students and students,

55
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:41,440
so return as students lease and Neal as return values of function per litre as students and.

56
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,400
Okay.

57
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,400
Reformat the code and save the project.

58
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,540
Now we could define the function name, select all the students by name that fits all students of a

59
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,840
student talent in person database by the given name.

60
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:04,370
In this session, we were able to design the database lower and create two functions in its role and

61
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,720
function to fetch a student based I.D. and one function to first niece of a student based on the given

62
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,320
name in order not to prolong the time of decision.

63
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,820
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

64
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,600
Goodbye.
