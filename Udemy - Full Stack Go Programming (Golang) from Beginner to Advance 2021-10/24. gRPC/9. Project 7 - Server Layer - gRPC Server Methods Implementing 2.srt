00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,030
Hello and welcome to the Go programming language course in the previous session, we could implement

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:25,440
get a student by the metal and in decision we want to implement, get the students by name function

3
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,540
first, uncomment these unimplemented method

4
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,950
and clear.

5
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,900
This venue and bright orange

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:56,000
set a variable like server by the type G.R. PC controller as implements the function server asterisk

7
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:09,200
G.R. PC controller, get a students by name and set a variable like name to point the search by name

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,690
message from political package name and set the asterisk.

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,790
And sit search by name message from political package protocol, search by name message.

10
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:34,930
And insert a variable like groups of students as a student service on their school, give the students

11
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,330
by name server from political package.

12
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:44,710
So we write G R P C is students from.

13
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:57,440
Portal call dot, the student service underscore give the students by name server.

14
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,310
And said return tide, that isn't there at all.

15
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:07,930
OK.

16
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,480
The method was created.

17
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:17,720
Now we have to implement its body by calling the server object from the GOP controller is right.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,900
It has access to the DB connection field through which we can con the get the students by name method

19
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,720
to their exit and name variable as input parameter and return to values.

20
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,810
First, honest students whose name are equal to the input parameter and second values a URL.

21
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:45,030
So we define two variables like the students and arrow.

22
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,350
Collins equals set server object.

23
00:02:50,270 --> 00:03:01,100
Dance and call Debbie Connection, object and dance, invoke, get a students base name

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:14,600
and can't get main function from the search by name message by calling name variable name.

25
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,750
Don't get name fonts.

26
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,260
First check area status if

27
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,770
they're not equals mean greeter.

28
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,370
All.

29
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,620
To iterate the values inside is to dance the youth, the range loop, so that we can display the values

30
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,870
inside each record separately.

31
00:03:47,020 --> 00:04:00,070
So we for on the score comma a variable name like a student call and equals range in the student's.

32
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,910
Because the return value of the jet as students by name method is the least students of the modern package

33
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,120
while we need a students of our port to find.

34
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,230
So we need to convert each model student to party student.

35
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,860
So use a controller to your PC, a student function.

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,280
So first, define a variable like geography.

37
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,220
See a student.

38
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,670
Colin Equals and now Colin commented, Your a student function convert to democracy, student function

39
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:46,400
and pass each model a student as parameter for it and get the politics student is two students.

40
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:56,590
Now we sent each port a student to the G.R. PC Students Stream by calling send function from G.R. PC

41
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:06,120
Port of Fi that accept students from Port of Phi and return an error so define an error variable error

42
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,790
calling equals from your PC.

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,870
Student is calling send function G.R. PCs to this.

44
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:26,920
Calling send function and sit G.R. a student as prompter for it, G.R., see the students.

45
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:30,930
Okay.

46
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,220
And check Iran's status if

47
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:45,130
they're not equals mean return terror

48
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,160
and return, Neal, as return value of the function.

49
00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:04,100
Peter Neal reformat the code and save the prices, OK in this session, neither able to complete the

50
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:12,590
package related to G.R. PC controller by entering the student on the school G.R. PC to that go fine

51
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:20,330
and receiving the all implemented metals related to the server section and implementing them in our

52
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,620
your service.

53
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:29,060
Now the client can use these functions and call them in order not to prolong the time of decision.

54
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,020
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

55
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,890
Goodbye.
