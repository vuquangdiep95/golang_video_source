00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,210
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,850
We could define a database layer.

3
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:26,420
And in this session, we want to establish the communication between geographies on the database.

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,900
Now it's time to design, to serve our part.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:41,090
First, go to explore and create a project folder like name server create project on the server.

6
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,800
And crude often can't service controller.

7
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,320
Me fine.

8
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,850
Service

9
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,000
controller that grew.

10
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:13,200
Here, Yvonne, to implement different parts related to G.R. PC service, to be able to communicate

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,030
with the metals in the database.

12
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,300
Create distraught and inside it.

13
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,820
Recreate the field from the DB, initialize the racetrack of the DV tools package.

14
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,540
And in this way, we establish the connection between the database layer and G.R. PC layer.

15
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,980
So we right?

16
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:49,440
First package, Serbia and Tie sit a name for a strike like she are PC controller destruct

17
00:01:52,230 --> 00:02:06,090
define a variable by the type of DB initial laser, for example DB connection from asterisk DB tools

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,660
DB initial laser.

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,600
We now have access to the components needed to use the database.

20
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,470
You need to initialize the connection fields so that you can use it to connect to the metals in the

21
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,220
database.

22
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,740
To do this, we need to calm the iconic metal from the DevTools package.

23
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,730
The return value of this metal is another object from the deep initialize restaurant, and using it,

24
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,380
we can set the TV connection, fill in the GRB controller extract.

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,120
Now we go to create the function and implements this.

26
00:02:46,270 --> 00:03:00,550
So the right phone set the name for function like job is the service initialize our G, our PC server

27
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,450
initialize the.

28
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,650
And set to require parameters for using conic function to create a connection to the database first,

29
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:30,690
its driver name and second is data source name, driver name, history and data source name is Streak.

30
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:41,580
This function is supposed to return to values for us first anarchic from GOP controllers strike and

31
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,750
the other is an error object.

32
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,170
So we say the pointer of the controller

33
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,270
asterisk g, our PC controller.

34
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,540
And sit and a little.

35
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,350
Now go to implements the body of function.

36
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,020
It's time to call connect function from debate tools package.

37
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,290
First, define two variable life dividend a rule.

38
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:20,000
The B and rule calling equals the B tools that connect.

39
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,840
Sit driver name

40
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,060
and said it a source name.

41
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,320
Check our status.

42
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,950
If you're not equals, need

43
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,850
greater need and you're all.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,690
And return and the object from G.P.S. controller is right and initialized, deep connection field of

45
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:05,860
eat by debris field created from Colin cunning function of DevTools package so we could initialize DB

46
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,770
connection field for using in this package.

47
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,280
So we'll be right return.

48
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,690
And for some.

49
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:24,990
Dear PC controller and initialize the.

50
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:37,180
Connection by theory and set the format the called and save the project.

51
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:45,600
Now we could create a function named G.P.S. server initialization if we call the G.R. PC server initialize

52
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,690
a function by initializing its input parameters.

53
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:57,040
We can initialize the DB connection field of the G.R. PC controller struct and using it, we will have

54
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,370
access to the database methods to prepare for the operation by G.R., PC, etc. In order not to prolong

55
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,980
the time of the session, we will finish.

56
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,020
She then will continue the content in the next session.

57
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,680
Goodbye.
