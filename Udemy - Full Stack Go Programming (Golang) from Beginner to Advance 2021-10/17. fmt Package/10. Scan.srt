00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,600
Hello and welcome to the goal and putting it on language course in the previous session, we talked

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,300
about it in function and indecision.

3
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,130
We want to talk about the other half empty package concept.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,090
This can function.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:45,820
The scan function in Go language scans, the input texts, which is given in the standard input reads

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,060
from there, and it stores the success of the space separated values into successive arguements.

7
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,360
Values that are separated by a space or new lines are key to those multiple values.

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,510
There are also multiple arguments.

9
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,220
Moreover, this function is defined under the empty package here.

10
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,810
You'll need to import this empty package in order to use these functions.

11
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,850
Now you can see the syntax here.

12
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,250
A tree interface receives each type of the given text.

13
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,990
In return, it returns the number of items successfully scanned.

14
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,920
Now let's go to a school program to illustrate the uses of this scan function.

15
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:44,620
First, declare some variables by different data types, for the example, for defined name Vash, name

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:02:01,750
this range and for age their age end and for March that March float 32.

17
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,690
And has it been accepted or not?

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,150
There is an.

19
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:17,590
Pool now conning your skin function for scanning and reading the input takes given in the standard input

20
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:25,960
BoyleSports before past the variable as we use ampersand symbol for the example for CET value from input

21
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,970
a standard name.

22
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:36,250
So we write, if empty lots can enter some name

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:53,860
and do these for other variables, go to the next line F.A. Dot, Scan, Sit and age and 50 Dot Scan

24
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,040
and March

25
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:17,740
and F.A. Dot scan and is exit now printing the given ticks if empty dot print.

26
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,940
If a

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:37,690
person is present, the percent F and person T and said the variables name four person s age four percent

28
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:47,980
be mark four percent F and E's exit four percent t the format.

29
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,850
The call save the project and execute the program.

30
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:02,620
Now the insert value that full name time change into four age time.

31
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,580
For the example.

32
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:13,660
Twenty five keynoter for March ninety point fifty and for easy exit sit through and into.

33
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,810
Now we can see the output v we're able to get the variables value from using.

34
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,910
This can function from the standard input and pre-destined.

35
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,250
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish sheet and we will continue the content

36
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,360
in the next session.

37
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,110
Goodbye.
