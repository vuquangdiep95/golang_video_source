00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,720
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session we talked about

2
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,670
is can Alan Fonctionne?

3
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,980
And in this session, we want to talk about other empty package concept.

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,150
If she can function.

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,150
The EFSF can function and go languorous, its cards, the specified takes leads from Io dot reader and

6
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:48,670
then it the successive Espace separated value into successive arguments here.

7
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,450
New lines get counted as a space, unlike other Eskin functions.

8
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:02,340
This conflict improved firm user or the program console in default formatting, efficient reads content

9
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,680
or takes from the input file and returns the known of items pass.

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,000
It reads Character wise, progress direction depends on the point or location you provide.

11
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,350
Moreover, this function is defined under the empty package.

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,330
Here, you'll need to import the empty package in order to use this function.

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,000
Now you can see the syntax.

14
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,220
Parameters, this function accepts two parameters which are illustrated below.

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,600
First, our type is i o dot reader.

16
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:46,350
This parameter contains this can specify text and the either a tree that either face this parameter

17
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,410
receives each type of the specified texts and returns value.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,310
It returns the number of items successfully scanned.

19
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,380
Now go to the school program to illustrate the uses of efficient function.

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:17,530
First, declaring some type of variables that may destroy their age, eat that mark.

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,790
Float turn two and that is accept bowl

22
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:34,060
now, calling the new reader function to specify some type of text variable.

23
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:45,130
A scan contains the scan takes, so write a scan column equals some strings package in new reader function

24
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:59,470
and set value like Roberts and three, five, four, eight and nine to five point fifty four mark and

25
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:08,580
total for the IS accept that even now, calling the office can function to receive this scanned text.

26
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:18,610
First, define two variables like number and you are calling equals from the F.A. package.

27
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:30,040
Be invoked if the scan method and sets for first argument is scan and then set the value of a large

28
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,160
Andersen name.

29
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:41,950
Ampersand, H, Ampersand, mark and Ampersand is exit.

30
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:54,340
If the above function returns an error, then Bill, our statement will be executed if we are not equals

31
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,700
to mean.

32
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:12,190
So, right, if A. don't have plaintiff from the this package select is T D, B, R R and sits message

33
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:22,300
if skin color person v. bank and and sit very well at all.

34
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,670
Now printing each type of a scan takes number of items successfully.

35
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:41,920
A scanned FP number of elements set no variable.

36
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:58,190
And the other variable name, age and mark and is exit reform the call, save the project and executed

37
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,840
the program.

38
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:09,890
Now we can see the output number of elements four and values Robert, four main and three five for age

39
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,350
and ninety five point fifteen for Mark and threw for easy exit.

40
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:21,290
Now we were able to get the variable its value from using fse and function and print.

41
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:28,520
Then in order not to prolong the time of decision, they will finish it and we will continue the content

42
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,540
in the next session.

43
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,220
Goodbye.
