00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,060
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,480
We talk about Eskom function, and in this session we want to talk about the other half empty package

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,110
concept.

4
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,820
This kind of function.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,760
The issue, the function and go language is against the input tax, which is given in the standard input

6
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,240
leads from there and distorts the substance of the space is separated values into successive arguments

7
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,310
as determined by the formats.

8
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,530
Just like this fancy language, very format is Spitfire is mentioned.

9
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:04,290
And then the address of the variable where the input value is to be restored is kind of Ingo Lang scans

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,830
text read from standard input and its those in the arguments as per the specified format.

11
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,210
Moreover, this function is defined under the empty package.

12
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,130
Here, you'll need to import this empty package in order to use this function.

13
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,440
Now you can see the syntax parameters.

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,120
This function access to parameters which are illustrated below.

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,260
Format type is the extreme, this is the different formats which are used for each given elements and

16
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:45,160
a T that interface, these parameters receive each given elements and returns value.

17
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,640
It returns the number of items successfully scanned.

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,210
Now let's go to this school program to illustrate the uses of this kind of function.

19
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,520
First, declare some variables by different data types.

20
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:14,260
For the example for defining that name, SED is string type, and for age that's a sit ins.

21
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,390
And for March, that March float 32.

22
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,840
And has it been accepted or not?

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,970
We said that is accept and time for it is ball.

24
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,220
Now, calling it scan the function for scanning and reading the input takes even in this this the input

25
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:51,230
for this word first pass vesting format or conversion characters of selected value of it and set the

26
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,460
value of it before passed a variable as arguments.

27
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:00,130
So we use ampersand symbol before each value to form two dots.

28
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:07,040
Scan F for the example, for set value from input, their standard to name variable.

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:15,500
We write first person s means Issing format for the name variable because it is a string per cent s

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,040
and then CET variable will ampersand symbol and person name.

31
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,960
And do these for other variables go to the next line f m t the scan f

32
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:49,790
person D and Ampersand H conversion character for each EAS percent d, and if empty dot scan f percent

33
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,810
f and set ampersand mark

34
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:06,860
f m t dot scan f first sent T and ampersand is exit

35
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,910
now printing the given text F.A. dot print f

36
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:27,980
percent s person the person F and person T and set these variable for these conversion character name

37
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,590
h mark.

38
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:45,390
And is accept, reformat the court, save the project and execute the program first into desired values

39
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:58,620
like Gene for nine and twenty four age and eighteen point fifty four mark in total for these exit and

40
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,070
interview.

41
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:08,250
Now we can see the output, so we were able to get the variable value from using Iskandar function from

42
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,100
the standard input and print them in order not to prolong the time of decision.

43
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,030
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

44
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,750
Goodbye.
