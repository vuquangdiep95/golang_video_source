00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,730
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,290
Eskin function.

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,630
And in this session, we want to talk about the other half empty package concept.

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,810
S skin function.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,890
The scan function in Golden Goose scans, this specified ticks and is sold to successive estates separated

6
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,250
takes into successive arguements as a skin walks similar to his skin, except the difference that it's

7
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:57,920
can collect input as the argument is strong and not the input from the consulate screen in the default

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,520
formatting.

9
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,140
Moreover, this function is defined under the empty package here.

10
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,400
You'll need to import their empty package in order to use this function.

11
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,140
Now you can see the syntax parameters.

12
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,310
This function accepts two parameters which are illustrated below.

13
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,100
First, SDR type is string.

14
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:27,410
This parameter contains the specified text, which is going to be scanned and a three dot interface.

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,430
This parameter receives each text and returns.

16
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,910
It returns the number of items successfully scanned.

17
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,960
Now, let's go to this school program to illustrate the uses of Siskind function.

18
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,310
First, declaring some value varies by the different times.

19
00:01:46,550 --> 00:02:01,540
For the example, their name is strange that age ain't that Mark felt very too.

20
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,910
And that is, I accept Paul

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:18,620
now calling the scan function, which returns the number of elements successfully scanned error or if

22
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,700
it is persists.

23
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:27,110
So we define two variables and return time for this system function and assign it to these variables

24
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:39,230
like number, comma, E. R. Collins equals and invoke essence and function from empty package if empty

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:52,190
40. As the scan set value for value, for example, Robert four nine two five four eight seven to nine

26
00:02:52,190 --> 00:03:06,560
point eighty four Mark and true for his accent and set variable for this value, ampersand name and

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:15,620
ampersand age and ampersand mar and ampersand is exit.

28
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:26,770
Below statements get executed if there is any or even e are not equals to mean

29
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,220
punish.

30
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:43,340
And sits there at all and now printing the number of elements and each elements of empty dot print earth,

31
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,650
no.

32
00:03:48,270 --> 00:04:10,770
All elements percent de Dash percent, this person, the person G and percent T and set variables.

33
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:18,570
Number four, despite a number of elements and set variables, name

34
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:30,150
age, mark and is exit the format.

35
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,540
The code saved the project and executed the program.

36
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:43,290
Now we can see the output number of elements is four and values are Robert four main twenty five for

37
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,020
a seventy nine point eighty four mark and through four is accepted.

38
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:56,400
Now we were able to get the variable this value from using a Siskind function and preens din in order

39
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,470
not to prolong the time of decision.

40
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,760
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

41
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,450
Goodbye.
