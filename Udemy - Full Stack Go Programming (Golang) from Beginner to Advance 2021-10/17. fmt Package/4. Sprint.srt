00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,580
Hello and welcome to the Ghoulam Programming Languages course in the previous session.

2
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:24,700
We talked about printing and function and in decision, we want to talk about the others this empty

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,930
package concept.

4
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,040
Aspirin function.

5
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:40,350
Are sprint function and go language formats using the default format for its operations and in return,

6
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,410
the resulting string is spinning functions the same them as Sprint does?

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,210
The only difference is that Sprint returns the input string instead of printing on the output console.

8
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,220
Here the spaces are added between operations, then any stream is not used as a constant by either.

9
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,570
Moreover, this function is defined under this empty package here.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,070
You need to import this empty package in order to use this function.

11
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,180
Now you can see this syntax here.

12
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:25,500
A three dot interface contains some strings, including a specified constant variables and return value.

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
It returns the resulting string.

14
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:35,800
Now, let's go to this school program to illustrate the uses of aspirin function.

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,870
First declaring some assumed variables.

16
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:53,940
That name value equals and initialized in go and programming.

17
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,700
Language.

18
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:07,710
And now calling his brain function first define a variable like result, calling equals from this empty

19
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:17,520
package, be called a spinning function and set variable like name and a string value is a set another

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:26,040
variable large value and set a new line that is large and now calling.

21
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:33,060
Write a string function from I or package to write or retain contents of this string function.

22
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,990
As a string result, thunderclouds go to the next line.

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:50,220
I start writing string and set CD out from, or is packaged as a writer or start out and set a string

24
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,750
line result.

25
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:59,730
The city out, also known as a standard output, is the default file descriptor or very process can

26
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,060
write output, reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

27
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,020
Now we can see the output go is a programming language.

28
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,770
First, we created a string value then and then using the sprint function, then we assigned the return

29
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,110
value inside the resort variable.

30
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,640
And finally, we print the value of the recent variable inside this standard output in order not to

31
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,430
prolong the time of decision will finish sheet and we will continue the content in the next session.

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,140
Goodbye.
