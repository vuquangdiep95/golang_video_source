00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,800
Hello and welcome to the golden and programming language course in the previous session, we talked

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,610
about escena function and in decision, we want to talk about the other half empty package concept.

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,550
Yes, again, Ellen, function.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,130
This scandal and function in language, it scans the input tax, which is given in this standard input

5
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,670
leads from there and distorts the success of the space separated values into successive arguments.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,440
These functions stop scanning at the new line and after the final item, there must be a new line or

7
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,250
end of fine.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,540
Moreover, this function is defined under the half empty package.

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,310
Here, you'll need to import the empty package in order to use this function.

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:14,330
Now you can see the syntax a tree dot interface receives, each given text and returns value.

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,750
It returns the number of items successfully scanned.

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,470
Now let's go to this school with program to illustrate the uses of this scantlin function.

13
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:37,420
Now, declaring some variables like that name and type of it is strange, and their age and time for

14
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,500
it is eight.

15
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:47,380
Now calling it function for scanning and reading, Dame could take given in this standard inputs for

16
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:54,850
this work before passed the variable as argument, the use ampersand symbol for the example for that

17
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,760
value from input a standard to name variable.

18
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,050
So we write F.A. Dot Scanlen.

19
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,110
And person name.

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:22,870
And do these for other variable Ethereum 2.0 skin and Anderson H now printing the given text FMV dot

21
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:32,770
print f Kurson s conversion character for name variable because it is a string and first in the converging

22
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:45,430
character for age variable because it is an integer and set variable name and age, reformat the code,

23
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:53,770
save the project and execute the program now into a desired value for this value that, for the name

24
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:01,960
the Inter chain, go to the next line by Inter and for the A's we import 13 Inter.

25
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,690
Now we can see the output chain name and thirty four h.

26
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,740
We were able to get the value builds value from using scantlin function from this standard input, then

27
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:21,490
print them in the above example with defined tool variables and assign values to each of them in the

28
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,150
new line.

29
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,740
For the example, one set value for name write value and presenter.

30
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:34,300
Four Go to the next line and set value for age variable so we could set values for these variables by

31
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,010
this candle and then function in order not to prolong the time of decision.

32
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,180
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

33
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,990
Goodbye.
