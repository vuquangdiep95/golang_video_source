00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,900
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,040
In the previous session, we talked about APIs and in decision, we want to talk about the others concept.

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,540
API specifications and protocols.

4
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:39,060
The goal of API specifications is to standardize data exchange between web services.

5
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,950
In this case, a standardization means that the ability of diverse systems written in different programming

6
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,230
languages and or running on different OSes or using different technologies to seamlessly communicate

7
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,280
with each other.

8
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:07,800
Remote parameter kon or our PC that APIs may add to a resource exchange principles based on a remote

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,910
procedure call.

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,150
This protocol is specifies the interaction between client server based applications.

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:24,300
One program, client requests, data or functionality from another program server located in another

12
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:32,780
computer on the network, and the server sends the required response on a PC is also known as a SOP

13
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,760
protein or function called one of two ways to implement a remote processor.

14
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,380
Colonies swap service, object access protocol or swap.

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:52,800
Swamp is a lightweight protocol for exchanging structured information in decentralized, distributed

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,840
environment, according to the definition by Microsoft that developed it.

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,380
Generally speaking, this a specification contains the syntax rules for requests and response messages

18
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:16,590
sent by web applications, APIs that comply with the principles of sweat in even some of the messaging

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:27,930
between systems through HTTP or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP for transferring made extensible

20
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,920
markup language.

21
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:39,000
Or it is a simple and very flexible text format widely used for data storage and exchange over the internet

22
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,590
or other networks.

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:49,410
SML defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that both humans and machines can read.

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,830
The markup language is a collection of symbols that can be placed in the text to detonate and label

25
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:07,110
the parts of the text documents examined text that humans contain self descriptive tags of data objects,

26
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,570
which makes them is little readable.

27
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:17,880
Slap is mostly used with the enterprise web based software to ensure high security of transmitted data.

28
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,540
Stop APIs are preferred among providers of payment gateways.

29
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:32,460
Identity management and CRM solutions, as well as financial and telecommunications services.

30
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,280
PayPal's public API is one of the commonly known swap APIs.

31
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,120
It's also frequently used for legacy systems support.

32
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,650
Representational state transfer or arrest?

33
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:56,610
The term race was introduced by computer scientist Roy Fielding in a distortion in 2000.

34
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,080
Unlike SLAPP, which is the Port of Call, Ernest is a software architectural style with six constraints

35
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,730
for building applications that work over HTP, often lip.

36
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,070
The World Wide Web is the most common realization and application of the architectural style.

37
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:26,550
Rest is considered a simpler alternative to swap, which made developers find difficult to use because

38
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,940
it requires writing a lot of code, complete every text and falling to a similar structure for every

39
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,230
message sent in this course.

40
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:42,380
The one to Explorist technology auction In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish

41
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,690
sheet and we will continue the content in the next session.

42
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,410
Goodbye.
