00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,860
Hello and welcome to the Goldens programming language course in the previous session, we were able

2
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,920
to make the configuration related to the server and set it up in this session.

3
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,930
The intent to send several rest end points from the client to the server.

4
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,080
To do these views, Postman's software.

5
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,760
But before do it, we should run the main method of the project by calling the main method the seven

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,600
is a starter.

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,790
And in the mode of listening to different requests to respond appropriately so first round the main

8
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,720
function go from.

9
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:03,530
There are two batches listening that go now server is running on the local on port 880.

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,240
Postman is an API development tool which helps to build, test and modify APIs.

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Almost any functionality that could be needed by any developer is encapsulated in this tool.

12
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,640
It has the ability to make various types of HTP requests like it paused PWD patch saving environments

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,440
for later use, converting to API to code for various languages.

14
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,820
Before running to APIs inside Postman's software, he first entered the MySQL database and checked the

15
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,430
lists of student in person schema.

16
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,840
Go to the person schema.

17
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,150
Go to the tables and go to a student table.

18
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,220
Right click on it and select Ruth.

19
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,510
Now we can see we have five records here, John.

20
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,110
Linda, Jack, David and Mary now go to Restaurant five and check the created a.

21
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,880
Go to risk config.

22
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,900
OK, here we have created four different API one to select.

23
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,680
All this didn't want to select a student based on the name.

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,210
Want to create a new student and want to update the student information.

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,260
So in the Post Man program, we can use these four APIs as client side requests.

26
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,530
It's time to go to the postman to execute our rest API.

27
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,530
Click on the plus side and enter our request.

28
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,580
You are in text, then then select your metal, then execute the API.

29
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,020
Suppose we want to see first the list of all the students.

30
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,150
To do this, we need to call the API for selecting all the student.

31
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,220
So first click on the plus side and in text field.

32
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,850
We write our rest API for select all the students we write low crime.

33
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:20,590
Horst KÃ¶hler 880 is less rest, less API and is less the students.

34
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,360
Then the method defined for this API is gittes, so select get method from methods drop down.

35
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,630
By default, here is gittes and now send the request frontline. into the server.

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Now we can see the output, we see all the students of student table by calling Rest API I one John

37
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,760
age 45 five, named Linda I the eight named Jack.

38
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,410
I did nine named David and I did 10 name Mary.

39
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:10,360
Do this again for another request in this case, you want to see a student base its name to do this.

40
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,410
We need to call the API for select a student based name.

41
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:30,520
So we write localhost call and 880 if this risk slash API slash student and slash its name, for example,

42
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,330
which

43
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,780
the method is get and press send button.

44
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:47,710
Now we can see the information of the Jack, a student I.D. eight named Jack and age 25.

45
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,070
Do this again for other requests.

46
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,170
In this case, we want to save in the Student two database to do this.

47
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:03,550
We need to call the API for save students, so click on the plus sign right?

48
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,090
Localhost Column 80 18.

49
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,010
Yes, less serious.

50
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,260
Less API and business is still there.

51
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,540
Is less at.

52
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,950
Select the body, tap below where to enter the API.

53
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:34,140
Then select the RO option and change its value from tax to Jason.

54
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:45,030
Now enter the information of the student in JSON format in the box below and send it to the server so

55
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,410
political process and initialize a student field between them.

56
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,720
Note that the idea value will be added automatically to the database.

57
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,100
So, for example, Killebrew says

58
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,210
me

59
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,420
the right came

60
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:20,470
and set a comma go to the next line, and for age we set, for example.

61
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,710
Thirty three.

62
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:36,030
And the method defined for this API is post, so select post method from Method dropdown post and send

63
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,400
the request front line to their server.

64
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:47,100
Now, go to the database and select all the students again ran the query again.

65
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,360
Now we can see the output.

66
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,380
We see that IMU, a student, has been added to the list.

67
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,540
13 name team and age 33.

68
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,350
Do this again for other requests now, go to the postman and continue,

69
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,560
in this case, we want to update and N'existe a student database to do this.

70
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:29,190
We need to calm the API for Update is student, so we write localhost column 88, a server IP address

71
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,320
that's raised as much API as Part Perfect's.

72
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,660
It's not a student, it's less added as Pat.

73
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,030
Now we want to update a student debt we inserted in the previous calling API.

74
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:54,700
So go to a database and see its I.D. The idea of the Kinney's 13 go to the post, meaning continuing.

75
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,870
We write.

76
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,680
I.D.

77
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,910
Caller 13.

78
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,160
And we want to change the name of it to Tom.

79
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,950
And the method defined for this API is so Celek post method from Methods dropdown and send the request

80
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,810
from Client into the server.

81
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,680
OK, now go to database and select all the students again.

82
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:42,620
Here we have I do 13 by the name Jean and age 30 to execute the query again.

83
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,200
Now we can see the idea.

84
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,610
13 name change to tome and age 33.

85
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,110
OK.

86
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:58,070
In this session, we were able to establish communication between the client and the server to rest

87
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:05,780
API, either able to connect to the database, fetch the information inside the data and add a new record

88
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,690
to eat and edit the record in the table.

89
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,510
We have reached the end of this session.

90
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,160
I hope you have take full advantage of this session onto the next session.

91
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,790
Goodbye.
