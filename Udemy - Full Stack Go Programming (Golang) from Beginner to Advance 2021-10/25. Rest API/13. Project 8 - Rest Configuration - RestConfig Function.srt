00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,580
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the penalty session.

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:26,190
We were able to implement the rest functions and now it's time to implement the configurations related

3
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,510
to rest API.

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,660
So go to Project Folder and go to rest layer and create a go link file named like risk config.

5
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,210
So go to rest layer.

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,840
Create a new file like rest config,

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,370
first package name package rest layer.

8
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,730
First, we create and implements a method that is responsible for create different reporters to respond

9
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,090
to different U R L requests or end points.

10
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:18,350
So create a method name like race feek, this function ads that are water objects from Musk's package

11
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,850
as input parameter.

12
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,070
So we right find.

13
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,420
Rest, calm feet

14
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,030
and sit rotor as parameter from pole to love locks

15
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:39,970
rotor.

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:56,910
Relata registers roads to be matched and dispatches the handler, it implements the ITBP handler interface

17
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,810
so it can be registered to serve requests.

18
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:10,800
Now we want to define an end point as per fix or a fixed value that exists in all and points for rest.

19
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,360
So from the rotor object, we call the get perfect method and set our fixed end point in it.

20
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,530
So first, define the variable light rare throughout our wrist.

21
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:37,500
Lauter call it equals from rotor object calling pass per fix function, rotor dart pass per fix function.

22
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:48,750
For example, we said it's less risk if this API, as fixed endpoint in all requests sits, is less

23
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,380
rest.

24
00:02:49,890 --> 00:03:03,810
This last API and then calling SOP rotor function dot sop rotor stop rotor function creates a somber

25
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,130
rotor for the road.

26
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:13,410
It will test the inner roads only if the parents route matched, so we were able to define a common

27
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,530
end point as a perfect for our requests.

28
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,240
Now we want to create different endpoints.

29
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,800
Suppose we want to return all the students of this student table from person database by calling in

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,180
and point of view on it.

31
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:38,970
To do this, we do the following current methods function from the created resource rotor for set type

32
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:45,510
of requests, methods, function registers and new role within a matter for ESTEP methods.

33
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,090
In this case, we want to use yet requested sore right

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,740
wrist rotor.

35
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,390
Net methods.

36
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:12,270
And so it gets as a request site and calling pass function, pat function.

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,570
That's a matter for the U.S. to pat it, accept a template with zero or more.

38
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,630
You are all variables enclosed by credit braces.

39
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,860
The template must start with the restless and variable names must be unique in a given route.

40
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:36,090
In this case for which all the students we set that Pat's like as a student, so we write Dot.

41
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,420
And since it's less students.

42
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:59,490
And then calling handler function dog handler function, this function sets a handler function for the.

43
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:08,010
Now we need to give a function handler as a parameter to dismantle and see what is going to do for us.

44
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,610
Now, Paul's a functional handler from a rest function, fine as arguments in this case.

45
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:24,100
We want to focus on students, so be in books, select all students function, select all students function.

46
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:32,580
So we were able to create an end point to fetch all the students from a student table of the person

47
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,540
database.

48
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:43,400
Now we create another employee to first a student based name from the database to do this.

49
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:53,630
We do the following culling methods function from the created wrist rotor faucet type of request wrist

50
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,140
rotor dots methods

51
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,940
type of the request in these cases get sit packed

52
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,660
in this case for a student base its name.

53
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:19,110
Set apart like SLAC student slash caliber SS and set the name name variable as parameter.

54
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:33,050
So the right list student slash curly braces sit a variable ask parameter, for example.

55
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,400
In this case, we sit name.

56
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,360
And calling handler function.

57
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:52,660
In this case, we want to fit a student base its name solving would select a student based name function

58
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,780
as handler function, select a student base name.

59
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:06,430
So we were able to create a named point to fit a student base its name from a student table of the person

60
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,450
database.

61
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:15,580
Now create another end point, for example, to seven new student into person database, so go to the

62
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,000
next line calling method function from restful to this role to what methods?

63
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,610
In this case, we want to use post as requested and calling pant function.

64
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:40,370
So we write post as request type and calling pad function.

65
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,750
We want to insert a new Sudan.

66
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,380
So we said the part like that special student, a class act.

67
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,840
It's less student.

68
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,120
It's less act and cutting handle the function.

69
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,120
We need to give a function handed as a parameter.

70
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:14,350
In this case, we want to save a new student so we can save a student function, save the student function.

71
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,750
So we were able to create an endpoint to save in the student.

72
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:28,310
And now we want to create another endpoint to update existing student into a person database.

73
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,860
So calling methods function from this role to their slaughter.

74
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,760
NATO's function

75
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:49,730
and in this case, we use from post as a request type post calling pad function.

76
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:00,190
We want to update in New Sudan, so we said that Pat Riley is such a student, this last edit is less

77
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,340
students, is less headed and invoke have their function.

78
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,360
In this case, we want to update annexes to Sudan, so we won't update is to then function from rest

79
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:26,240
functions, update students, OK, the format, the code and save the project.

80
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:35,420
Now we were able to implement the rest config methods to create different rotors like save, update

81
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,530
and select.

82
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:44,110
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue to contend in

83
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,980
the next session.

84
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:45,730
Goodbye.
