1
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,610
Hello and welcome to the Golden Age programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,450
We could define iconic method for connection to the database.

3
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,510
And in this session, we want to create another functions to perform craft operations.

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,580
First, the assault by writing the quiz related to the select statement, so create a function to select

5
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,900
all the students records and return as students, Eric.

6
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,240
So we write funk,

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,870
select all students and return tie.

8
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,610
Array of model got a student?

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,180
Now calling connect function for initializing my school driver, my name and datasource name, this

10
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,140
function returns a DBI object from a school package.

11
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,780
This gives us access to metals contained in the package to perform crud operations.

12
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:28,390
So define a variable like DB calling equals and invoking chronic function.

13
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:38,860
After creating a deep object, the Invoke query method that it executes a query that acts it is cruel

14
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,060
curious statement as string parameter and returns rolled and over objects.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:55,060
So first, define two variables like roles and erode column equals the B dot query.

16
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,850
In this case, we want to see all the students in the student table.

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,520
So we should use select query statement.

18
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,600
So we write Select Query has a string parameter.

19
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,110
Select a star for the student.

20
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,060
Go to the next line check earner status, if at all.

21
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:33,010
Like the fat on the road, how we use the ether for clothing to create a DB object.

22
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,090
Ether DB don't close.

23
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:46,090
We create the least of a student strike to add to each new student that is read from the database,

24
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:53,350
from the student table and at the end of fetching data from the database, the student list is displayed

25
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,360
by the method return value.

26
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,320
So do you find it?

27
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,560
Very.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,280
It is like a students column equals

29
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,630
model dots.

30
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,430
Students

31
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:16,420
now put the return value of the query inside a up to access each of the rows by the next function.

32
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,510
So we write for those dots next.

33
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,190
Next, fashion prepares the next results are all for reading with this method.

34
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:41,580
If returns to an success or false, if there is no mixed result draw or and it all happened while preparing

35
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,520
it, so create an object from a student.

36
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:53,790
This rock is student calling it cool modern art student.

37
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:04,470
And calling it method on Rove's resolve to it recalls one by one, the skin crawl is the Collins in

38
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,250
the car and throw into the values pointed at by destination.

39
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,190
The number of values in this nation must be the same as a number of the Collins in defined an enormous

40
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:22,440
debate and in scan function at all equals roles not scanned.

41
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,670
Is Student Ideas Pointer Anderson, Student Dot.

42
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:43,990
IED said a student named Ampersand Student dropped name and set a student age as pointer and her son,

43
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:54,220
Student Dot H scanned Converse columns read from the database into the following come and go types and

44
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,540
especial type provided by the astute package.

45
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:10,060
So check your status if they're not equals mean like dots, fatal error, dot arrow and continue.

46
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:22,420
I will be at each readers record that contains a student to the list of students by the app in function.

47
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,070
Students.

48
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,810
Equals app and function as students, as students

49
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,660
now will return as student and return values of function, return as students.

50
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,500
Now we could define the function and select all the students that fit all the students of a student

51
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,800
table in person database by the select the statement.

52
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,010
Now we want to create another select function.

53
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,890
In this case, we want to fit a student body condition.

54
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,990
Otherwise, we create a query by a very close for this sandpit.

55
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:10,850
We want to define the function that returns a student base, a student name, first define the function,

56
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,580
then select a student based name.

57
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,460
The packs it and is string as name and return a student based that name value.

58
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:27,720
So, right, find select a student

59
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:44,340
based name and set a name as a parameter by the time string named as string and return value is modeled

60
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,470
after students.

61
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:55,110
Now cutting clinic function for initializing my school driver, so define a variable like TV calling

62
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,910
equals panicked

63
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,470
after creating a deep object.

64
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:09,780
The invoked 20 year old method that it executes a query that is expected to return at most Marvel query

65
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,530
role method always returns and non mean value.

66
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:24,530
So defined roles variable and Colin quitted role method roles column equals VB don't query role.

67
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,430
In this case, we want to select a student in a student table by based on the given name, and we should

68
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,260
use Select Query Statement.

69
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,580
We are very close, and so writes the a query as a string parameter.

70
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,920
Select a star from.

71
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,740
A student and said very condition based name where.

72
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,690
Name instead of name value.

73
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,020
Put a question mark equals question mark.

74
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,630
And as a second parameter, we received the name value from the inside the method.

75
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,990
So we right name.

76
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,570
Use differ for closing the creator TBE object, the ether db dot low.

77
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,650
Now we create an object from a student who struck the student card and equals model dot.

78
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,080
A student.

79
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:40,700
And Corning is gunmetal on the rolls, results right record defined an incredible animal, skin functions

80
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,120
to be right, erode calling equal roles.

81
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:58,170
Thoughts can set a student i.d.s pointer, ampersand, student I.D. and a student name, anthracite

82
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:06,950
student name and age ampersand student Dot H.

83
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:15,380
S can collars columns read from the database into the coming do times and the spatial type white the

84
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,670
misspelled pages.

85
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,020
So first check entry status, if at all not equal.

86
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:30,890
Is Neil like don't at all dot her or now return a student as return value off function.

87
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,720
If the student is not available, the normal value will be returned with the seller name return per

88
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,410
student.

89
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,700
OK, now we could define a functioning select.

90
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:50,300
A student based name that reads her is student of a student table in person database by the cynic.

91
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,880
The statement based name value in order not to prolong the time of decision.

92
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,990
Will finish it, and we will continue the content in the next session.

93
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,710
Goodbye.
