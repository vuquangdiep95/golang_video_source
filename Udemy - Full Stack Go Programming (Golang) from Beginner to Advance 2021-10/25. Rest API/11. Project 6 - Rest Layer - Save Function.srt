00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,800
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course in the pit of your station.

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:25,700
We could define select all students method for rest player, and now we want to implement another function

3
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,160
that is supposed to insert a student in the student table of person database.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,410
So define the function named like save as student dysfunction.

5
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,680
Accept two parameters first and object from issue type response writer and second, the pointer of a

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,120
steep request.

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,270
So we try find.

8
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,450
Save the student and set two parameters.

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,850
First, a parameter response writer response.

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:22,480
By the time TTP, the arts response writer and second request from Pointer Poynter Institute art request.

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,430
Now we want to implement a body of dysfunction.

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,220
This violation is supposed to save a new student and database.

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:44,710
So we should convert the data we received from the end point into a student object and save it in the

14
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,310
database.

15
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:53,260
To do this, we do the following first, create an object of a student model so defining variable like

16
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,980
the student from modern a student.

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,130
Therefore, we received the data sent from the client to the body in the request by the new decoder

18
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,350
function from Jason Typekit and saw it into a student object.

19
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,850
This function returns a new decoder that reads from reader.

20
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:28,460
So first, define an error variable as return time, roll call and equals and calling new decoder function.

21
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:46,130
Jason Start new decoder function and set body of request as argument request, dot body as argument

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:56,960
and calling decode function thought decode and Esaw to receive data into a student model and person

23
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,820
a student.

24
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,710
Now, check Iran's status, so right, if there are.

25
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,960
Not equals, Neal.

26
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,110
For example, if at all,

27
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:26,320
and set an interim status in response, Heather and displayed for a client by the FBI to function saw

28
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,060
the right response.

29
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,490
That's right, Heather

30
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,560
and select an overall status as argument from the SDP package.

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,590
For example, HTP thought a status internal seller of the status.

32
00:03:48,840 --> 00:04:02,550
Internal server error and displayed for client by colleague F.A. Dot F printer function, Sid responds

33
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:15,300
as first argument Sid misses, for example, could not add new students

34
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,780
by

35
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:28,200
error calling personally and set error variable that.

36
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,000
And set the return value return

37
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:44,360
now connect to the database, then call the courier to save and the students, so we write DV tools.

38
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,040
And colleagues say function.

39
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:59,470
And sit a student as argument for dysfunction students, the format, the code and save the project.

40
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,210
Now we were able to implement the same function that at a new student into the database based data receiving

41
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,910
from client various API in order not to prolong the time of decision.

42
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,930
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

43
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,620
Goodbye.
