00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:18,820
Hello and welcome to the go and programming language course in the Pentagon's session, we talked about

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,920
this API's concept and indecision.

3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,490
We want to talk about the others concept.

4
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:38,980
Types of APIs in terms of released policies, APIs can be private partner and public private API.

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,990
These are application software interfaces are designed for improving solutions and services within an

6
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,720
organization in house.

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:57,820
Developers or contractors may use these APIs to integrate as a company's I.T. system or applications.

8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:07,390
Build new systems or customer facing apps leveraging existing systems, even if apps are publicly available.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,140
The interface itself remains available only for those working directly with the API publisher.

10
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:23,340
The private estratÃ©gia allows a company to fully control the API usage partner API.

11
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:33,200
Partner opinions are only apparently prompt, but share with business partners who have signed an agreement

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,100
with the publisher.

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:43,310
The common use case for partner APIs is software integration between two parties, a company that grants

14
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,250
partners with access to data or tapping ability.

15
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,130
Benefits from extra revenue streams.

16
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:59,500
At the same time, it can monitor how the exposed digital assets are used in ensure whether to party

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,200
solutions using their APIs, provide decent user experience in Maine to incorporated identity in their

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,680
apps.

19
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,430
Public APIs.

20
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:20,640
Also known as developer facing or external, these APIs are available for any third party developers.

21
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:29,580
The public API program allows for increasing brand assurance and receiving an additional source of income

22
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,290
than properly executed.

23
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,240
These are two types of public APIs open in commercial ones.

24
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:46,940
The open API definition suggests that all features of such an API are public and can be used without

25
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,190
restrictive terms and conditions.

26
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:57,680
For instance, it's possible to build an application that utilize the API without explicit approval

27
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,790
from the API supplier or mandatory license fees.

28
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,550
The definition also states that the API description and any related they can mention must be openly

29
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:16,580
available, and the API can be freely used to create and test applications.

30
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:31,420
API use cases API can be classified according to the systems for which they are designed.

31
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:41,590
Database API Database API enable communication between and that application and a database management

32
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,130
system.

33
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,300
Developers work with the database by running queries to access data, changed tables and etc.

34
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,430
They did open seven.

35
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,960
Database API, for example, allows users to write unified queries for different databases.

36
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,200
Both proprietary and open source.

37
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:10,000
Another example is AWS Database API, which is an embedded into Oracle Rest Data Services, Operating

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,320
Systems APIs.

39
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:20,620
This group of APIs defines how applications use the resources and services of operating systems, every

40
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,410
OS has its sets of APIs.

41
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:31,420
For instance, Windows API or Linux API by Terminal users faces API and channeled into not API.

42
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,400
Apple provides API reference for Mac OS and iOS.

43
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,570
In its developer, Dutcher mentioned APIs for building applications for Apple's Mac OS desktop operating

44
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,320
system are included in Kirkwall set of developer tools.

45
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,940
Remote appearance.

46
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:57,710
Remote APIs define the standards of interaction for applications running on different machines.

47
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,840
In other words, one software product accesses resources located outside the device that requested,

48
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,460
which explains the name.

49
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,810
Since two remotely located applications are connected over communications networks, particularly the

50
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,320
internet, most remote APIs are written based on very standards.

51
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,500
VVIP, ap, ice.

52
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:34,560
This API class is the most common lib APIs, Pearl White, machine readable data in functionality transfer

53
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,150
between web based systems, which represent client server architecture.

54
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:49,200
These APIs mainly deliver Acworth from web applications and responses from server using Hypertext Transfer

55
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,560
Protocol, or HTP.

56
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,380
Developers can use web APIs to expand the functionality of their apps or sites.

57
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,990
Two types of APIs are first server side.

58
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:13,850
Server side Web API is a programmatic interface that consist of one or more publicly exposed and points

59
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,760
to a defined records response message system.

60
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,030
It is typically expressed in JSON or expand the client site.

61
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,330
A client site, what API is a programmatic interface helps to extend functionality within a web browser

62
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,490
or other Typekit client.

63
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,240
Examples of that API are like Google Maps.

64
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:45,470
APIs allow developers to emit Google Maps and web pages by using a German script or flashing interface.

65
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:53,960
YouTube API allows developers to integrate YouTube videos and functionality into websites or applications.

66
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,140
Twitter offers two APIs.

67
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:06,620
The rest API helps developers to access Twitter data, and the Search API provides methods for developers

68
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:14,180
to interact with tweets or search, and Amazon's API gives developers access to Amazon's product selection

69
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,540
in order not to prolong the time of decision.

70
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,250
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

71
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,910
Goodbye.
