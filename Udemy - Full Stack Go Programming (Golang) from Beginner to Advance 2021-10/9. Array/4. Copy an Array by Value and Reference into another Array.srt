00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,330
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in this session, we want to talk about

2
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,830
the either added concepts.

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,860
Copy on at eight by value and reference into another.

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,950
You can create a copy of an array by assigning NRA to a new very bill, either by value or reference.

5
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:48,370
First value, then we assign the value of one validated in another value, then changing the first value

6
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,160
that does not change the second variable because the value of the first value that is copied to the

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,920
second variable, which is called the value second reference.

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:07,090
But then we assigned the address of one lady that in another variable changing the value of the first

9
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,550
that he had been honest to change the value of the second lady that it is called reference.

10
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:23,330
Now, go to this school and illustrate how to use to copy him at a boy venue and reference into an already.

11
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:37,340
First, define and add and initialize eat, for example, at a long calling equals this global markets

12
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:45,890
sit three for the length tied a string and curly brackets for initialize

13
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,980
Team

14
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,680
Dean

15
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,140
and be.

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,560
So create an array and copy at Avon into this in the next line.

17
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:14,120
Ray two calling equals and copy anyone to eat.

18
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,910
I want data is passed by value.

19
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,560
Now define another variable and copy anyone into this array.

20
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:41,750
Three content equals and copy the address of the variable at Avon into this and array one.

21
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:50,570
In this case, data is passed by a reference if we want to pass a reference value we use from ampersand

22
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,520
symbol before the variable.

23
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,950
Now display at Avon and added to if it

24
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:17,570
at a long balance percent v lowercase legislation and sets only one, then

25
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,050
it has

26
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:38,870
a two tolerance person to lowercase registers and and sets I to say inclusion and continue.

27
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,570
Now we change the index zero five at Avon Valley Bin and print on Vati.

28
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:58,280
Even again, do the following Add a long list of broadcast and index zero and we change the venue of

29
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,330
it to.

30
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,100
For the example, Alex

31
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,440
now display all the variables for these.

32
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,630
Copied these two lines

33
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,410
and paste here

34
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,420
for display the pointer variables we use from star symbol before variable name.

35
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,130
So for print the variable ADT, we use this code.

36
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,350
If if

37
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,400
at a tree pollens person to the lower case

38
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:58,740
and sets the star add a tree, the format, the cool, save the project and execute the code.

39
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,020
Now we can see the output in the first variable.

40
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,750
We have changed index zero value.

41
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,880
When you print it, the first variable is printed with the new menu in the second.

42
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:27,050
Very bad because the value of the first variable is copied inside it, or in other words, data is passed

43
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,920
by value.

44
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:36,350
So no change will be made in the second variable, but in the third variable, because the address of

45
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,140
the first variable is assigned in the third variable or in other wars.

46
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,210
Data is passed by reference.

47
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:51,020
The value of the first element of the third variable will also change and the third variable will be

48
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,520
printed within nil value.

49
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:02,950
Now we could copy and Ari by venue and reference into another area in order not to prolong the time

50
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,710
of decision.

51
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,510
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

52
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,470
Goodbye.
