00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,450
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,360
We want to talk about the other areas concepts.

3
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:37,620
Iterate over and add a you can iterate over and add a elements in different ways for loop, for accessing

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,760
great elements, range for accessing added elements.

5
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,400
Rains for accessing every element and do not display index.

6
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,940
And range in Lou, as if look.

7
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,500
First, we want to talk about for Loop, for accessing added elements.

8
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,940
Now go to Waskow and illustrate how to use Falou first, clear the last quote.

9
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:20,020
Save the project defined an 80 and initialize it, for the example, in Annie Hall and equals S-Corp

10
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:28,460
bracket set five value for the length of edit and end for the type of array and calibre rockets and

11
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,940
initialize the value one two, three four and comma fine.

12
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,940
Now display the values of an eight by four loop.

13
00:01:45,790 --> 00:02:01,750
Formed by calling equals zero I less than Len and I four create the condition for loop you can use from

14
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:12,240
length of arable land function and then I plus plus display that anybody by index.

15
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:21,630
So write these codes FP and add a high school breakfast and sit.

16
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,190
I very well here for return the value of each index.

17
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,530
Save the projects and execute the code first.

18
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,060
Go to the project folder.

19
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,350
See the array and draw on the project.

20
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,710
Now we can see the output.

21
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,850
In this case, one unit is added each time by A-plus, plus plants and fish to add eight elements value

22
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,920
by access to index of it, and we could iterate between added elements.

23
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:06,020
Now go to a slide and continue in this case, we want to talk about range for accessing added elements

24
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,920
and range for accessing added elements without index and range info low as a view.

25
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,760
Range.

26
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,980
The foreign statements supports one additional form that uses the key word range to iterate over the

27
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:36,650
next version that evaluates to an array a slice map extreme or Channon range victory, and this slices

28
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,950
it returns the index of the item as integer.

29
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:48,080
With maps, it returns the key of the next key value chain and range either returns one value or two.

30
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,230
You can see the syntax index is the index of the value we are accessing.

31
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:03,530
Value is the actual value you have on each iteration, and data holds the data structure whose values

32
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,030
will be accessed in the loop.

33
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,190
Now go to the school and do some example.

34
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:22,600
First, Hillier, the last call and comment this followed and iterate these very bad by the arrange

35
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,070
for.

36
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,420
Index common value.

37
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:38,170
Column he calls Ranj name of variable in array.

38
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,180
And display each element by index and value of FP.

39
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,870
Index.

40
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,250
And Value said the project executed the cold.

41
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:17,100
Now we can see the output and we could display each element of at a Y index and value.

42
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:30,150
In today, we can display just value by Iranians in follow up and do not display in their 40s or sit

43
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,170
on the score instead of index and solely print the value.

44
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,270
Now, clearest in the last full comment, this court

45
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:57,700
and to the following fall, instead of index, we sit on the risk for common value calling equals ranj

46
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:11,590
abbreviated entry and print, a value worth p value.

47
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,630
Save the project and execute the code.

48
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:32,360
Now we can see the output, the value of each element has created one two three four five and they could

49
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,240
display the value of each element without index by the range.

50
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,390
In the fourth day, we can use the range info loop as a viable loop.

51
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,970
Now here is screen comment, this court

52
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:04,870
and right there range in loop as a wire loop first define a very idea like J Call it equals zero is

53
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:18,340
as a counter and create a followed by range, full range and name or variable inside a display the value

54
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,560
of any in each iteration.

55
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:21,880
FP

56
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:37,510
inside a briefcase and set j variable here for which the variable value and after each iteration plus

57
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:44,800
plus JW Marriott and J Plus Plus Deformity Code said the project can execute the code.

58
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:54,350
Now we can see the output one, two, three, four five, and we could use the range in follow up advice,

59
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:00,310
look, in order not to prolong the time of this session, we will finish it and we will continue the

60
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,170
content in the next session.

61
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:02,920
Goodbye.
