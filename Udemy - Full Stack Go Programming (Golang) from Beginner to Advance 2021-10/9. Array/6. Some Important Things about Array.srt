00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,500
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,460
We want to talk about some important things about a race.

3
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:40,370
One, if an Ari does not initialize explicitly, then the default value of this attack is zero.

4
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,380
Two in A..

5
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,790
You can find the length of the array using land function.

6
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,460
Three in an area.

7
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:59,750
If ellipses become visible at the place of length, then the length of the array is determined by the

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,190
initialized elements.

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,850
Fold in an attack, you are allowed to iterate over the range of the elements of the array.

10
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,240
Five in an ad, if the element time of the era is comparable, then they're at a time is also comparable

11
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,850
so we can directly compare to and he's using equal to operate or.

12
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,950
Now go to a school program and do some exam pit about these, some important things.

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,060
14.

14
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,950
First case, you find out, does not initialize explicitly then the default value of this value is zero.

15
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,020
First, creating an array of ian type feature stores two elements.

16
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,170
Right.

17
00:01:53,030 --> 00:02:07,550
My Ray lengths to try this, and we don't initialize this any and display the very either.

18
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:16,710
FP, my Paris, save the project and execute.

19
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,330
We can see that output, so the value of daddy is zero because compiler assign different value for every.

20
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,250
OK.

21
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:38,530
Go to the next case in an array, you can find the length of the array using the land function first,

22
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,730
clear the last go

23
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,660
and creating two arrays using shorthand creation for the example array.

24
00:02:49,780 --> 00:03:05,350
One column equals length three time and clearly rockets one comma two comma three, and in the next

25
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:22,900
line, array two column equals length scythe by the ellipses and time is end and initialized by one,

26
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,490
two, three, four and five.

27
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:44,350
Now, finding the length of the array using land function, go to the next line FP length of a one column

28
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,860
land function and set the value.

29
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,340
It had a well.

30
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:05,050
Go to the next line and read this call for the either way, even if he brings

31
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:22,450
up a two and set the land function and array to save the project and execute.

32
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,230
Now we can see the output.

33
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,200
The length of at Avon is three and the length of three two is five.

34
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,210
Now we could find the length of +8 by land function.

35
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,070
Go to the next case in an array.

36
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,640
If ellipses become visible at the place of lengths, then the length of the array is determined by the

37
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,930
initialized elements.

38
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,490
First, clear the last court.

39
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:14,700
Create an add a whose size is determined by the number of elements present in it using ellipses for

40
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:28,610
the example array column he calls ellipses set for the length type is estrange and initialize by the

41
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,100
values for the example girl

42
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,640
Java

43
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,420
Seashore,

44
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,730
C++

45
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,600
and OK.

46
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,190
Displayed at a well, it's up against.

47
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,610
Oh hey, Colin.

48
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,200
On September 18 at.

49
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:16,850
And in the next line displayed the length of the alley that is determined by using land function, FP

50
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:27,900
length of a column and learn function and set the variable.

51
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,360
I saved the project and execute.

52
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,580
Now we can see the output and the length of play is five

53
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,870
and the next case in an array, you are allowed to iterate over the range of the elements of the array.

54
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,920
First, clear the last code,

55
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,050
creating an eddy whose size is represented by the ellipses.

56
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:19,100
For example, again, any equals sets and it says for the lengths type is it and initialize value by

57
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:29,930
10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60, Iterate added.

58
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,820
Using for loop four.

59
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,100
I call an equal zero I less than Len of anybody ever.

60
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:52,890
I + + now displayed to each element of every variable by the comment, if this person, the back is

61
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:06,700
less in and a square market index, I save the project, then execute.

62
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,370
Now we can see the output and we could iterate between any elements.

63
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,120
Go to the next case in an area.

64
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,000
If the elements time of the attack is comparable, then to at a time is also comparable, so we can

65
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,450
directly compare to arrays using equal to operator

66
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,110
first clear.

67
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,190
The last code

68
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,320
defined three arrays at a long calling equals five

69
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:54,220
and initialized by the values one, two, three, four and five.

70
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:02,560
Go to the next line and define another variable at a two Hallen equals set.

71
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:14,560
The last by the ellipses and type is end and initialized by the values one, two, three, four and

72
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,040
five.

73
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:26,230
And go to the next line and create another variable like add a three column equals set the length five

74
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:39,220
and type is eight and initialize the value for the example six to three, seven and nine.

75
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:53,620
Now comparing arrays using equal to operator for the example to compare, arrival in at A2 had a tool

76
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:04,690
by at eighty and eleven point eighty three if p at a Y equal to at a two.

77
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,360
And in the next line, if P

78
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,530
had a tool equal to at eight three and in the next line

79
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:29,500
had a one equal to a three, save the project and execute the code.

80
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:39,960
Now we can see the outpour first conversion is two and the other conversion is false.

81
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,230
We have reached the end of this session.

82
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,560
I hope you have taken full advantage of this session until next session.

83
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,180
Goodbye.
