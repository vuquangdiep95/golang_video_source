00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello and welcome to the and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about copyists

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,230
rock type using venue on point of reference and indecision.

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,320
We want to talk about the authors this truck's concept.

4
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:39,140
Anonymous is structure and filled in goal and first anonymous structure.

5
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,300
In go language, you are allowed to create an anonymous structure, an anonymous structure, is there

6
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:54,620
a structure which does not contain and name it useful when you want to create a one time use able instruct?

7
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,390
You can create an anonymous abstract using the following syntax.

8
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,680
Let's go to a school program to illustrate the concept of anonymous abstract.

9
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:18,630
First, creating an initializing the anonymous draft now go to main function and define a variable and

10
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:29,340
assign a strike to it without any name, for the example, a student column, because that's right.

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,560
And in these curly brackets defined as strike variable names, a strange

12
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,420
idea and for the example, 64.

13
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,730
And H, it's too early to.

14
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,770
And now open and other actually raucous and initialise defined as starter variables was

15
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,130
name

16
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,060
Julia

17
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,080
Heidi.

18
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:24,060
A hundred and two and three age 13 now display the anonymous abstract FP.

19
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,610
The student student format, the code, save the project and execute the program.

20
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,430
Go round and go.

21
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:44,130
Now we can see that we could define an anonymous astronaut, initialize it and display its variables.

22
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:53,220
Now go to a scientist and continue second anonymous fields in the growth structure, you are allowed

23
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,960
to create anonymous fields.

24
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,060
Anonymous spheres are those fields which do not contain any name.

25
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,330
You just simply mentioned the type of the fields and go will automatically use the type as the name

26
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,050
of the field.

27
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,610
You can create anonymous fields of this destroying using the following syntax in this right you are

28
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,420
not allowed to create two or more fields of the same type.

29
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,910
If you try to do so, the compiler, we give an error.

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,460
Let's go to the school program to illustrate the concept of anonymous fields.

31
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,950
First clear, the last court

32
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:50,450
in this case, creating a structure with anonymous skills tied a student is rocked

33
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,730
and set the type of very extreme

34
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,750
heat.

35
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:09,680
Now go to main function, assigning values to the anonymous filth of the student, a strike force case

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,290
defined and variable on assigned values to it.

37
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:21,740
For the example, value column equals the student's calibre class and sets the value for the variables

38
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,610
gene.

39
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,810
A hundred and twenty three for each now display the values of the fields.

40
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:40,130
If we assign a string to a student name and end to a student I.D., the student's name

41
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:59,230
value does this string and the student I.D. assign value, but it.

42
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,000
Be formatting codes saved the project and executed the program.

43
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,310
Now we can see the output.

44
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,140
We could define an enemy's fields, initializing and display them.

45
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,410
OK, we have reached the end of decision.

46
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,840
I hope you have taken full advantage of decision onto next session.

47
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,510
Goodbye.
