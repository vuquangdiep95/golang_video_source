00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,810
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,340
creating instances of historic times.

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,730
And in this session, we want to talk about the other instructions.

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:41,070
Mr Airstrike type, a structure which is the field of another structure is known as nested structure.

5
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,530
A stroke can be nested by creating a stroke type, using other times as the time for the field of a

6
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,700
struct listing given a stroke within another can be useful way to model more complex structures.

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,290
Now you can see the syntax for nest at the stroke type.

8
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,490
Now go to this good program to illustrate how to create the nested structure.

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,100
First, create a stroke name.

10
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,460
Also tie

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,070
hoser.

12
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,380
That's right.

13
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,200
Good practice and set the variable name Estrange

14
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,640
and branch.

15
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,710
This strange.

16
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,330
And year it.

17
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,260
And said a common for export, these distract.

18
00:01:52,750 --> 00:02:01,570
Oh, sir, distract, because first letter of all a is often the case.

19
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,970
So the author of Strike is unexpected, so you must use a comment about this structure.

20
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,200
Now, create another.

21
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,720
It's not like it's art that contains a field as opposed to a structured

22
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,010
time.

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,790
It's all this right kid brackets.

24
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:35,300
In this case, we define an also a that even for the example, we set name of this even as details details

25
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,470
also set the comment for export this right?

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,750
It's a story.

27
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,460
Reformat the code and save the project.

28
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,770
Now we could define two astronauts, first author and second, it's on now go to main function and create

29
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:09,810
an instance of each art instructor, create a variable drawing results from its Art Result column because

30
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,920
it's R. Kelly brackets and initialize its parameters details that it points to also a restaurant.

31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,440
So we create an instance from Oh sorry, and initialize it.

32
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:41,010
D turns full circle and assign the values like Julia and four branch e c E. and Year is 2020.

33
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:51,780
Reformat the code and go to the next line and display the values, the T the turns.

34
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,480
Oh, sir.

35
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:07,050
Go to the next line, and that's the result reform of the code, said the prosaic, and execute the

36
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,150
program, now we can see the output.

37
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,770
In this example, we were able to create two different structures and use them nested in each other

38
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:26,280
and display the values of its validators in order not to prolong the time a decision will finish it,

39
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,370
and we will continue the content in the next session.

40
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,210
Goodbye.
