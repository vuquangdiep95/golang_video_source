00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,280
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the conversation we talked about Method

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,850
can accept both points from value in decision.

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,910
We want to talk about the other this concept.

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,810
Assign different value for a struct field.

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:42,430
Method of assigning to custom default value can be achieved by using constructor function instead of

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,500
creating a strong directory.

7
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:51,520
We create a function can be used to create an struggled with the cost and default value for this distronic

8
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,270
feats.

9
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,760
Let's go to this good program to illustrate how to assign defined value for restaurant field.

10
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:17,430
First, create a strike named A-student, tie this to the restaurant called Graisses and define fields

11
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,480
for this strike.

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,970
Name is string and age.

13
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,870
It set the common above the established name for exporting, this student stressed.

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,520
Still, there are strict.

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:47,710
Now, create a metal for a student assignment name instance to set default value for a student feels

16
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,560
fine.

17
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,380
Set a receipt for a student as strong as S s as trees.

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,190
The student named for this metal, for example.

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,050
Instant, curly brackets.

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,920
In this case, set the default value for two fields, name and age.

21
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,210
If that name equals equals, no

22
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:38,050
less name equals rather than if it's the age.

23
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,800
Equals equals zero is that h equals twenty five.

24
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:56,050
The compiler checks if the field values are and so assigns, the value defined in this method as defined

25
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:05,770
values, voting set a comment for this method as export in turn

26
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,550
metals reform as they call, then save that provision.

27
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,220
Now, go to main function and create instances of student astrong and initialize value.

28
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,600
First, declare an instance and mete out assigned value is to that point where calling equals.

29
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:38,530
A student now invokes the instant method for initializing default values.

30
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:49,000
This student won't even stand up and display these students, right?

31
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:49,990
If

32
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,520
the student one

33
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:05,620
second declare another student instance and just initialize name value for it and don't assign any value

34
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,560
for each bit, go to the next line is to do that.

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,420
Two column equals the student and set name.

36
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,630
Julia?

37
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:40,840
Student to go out and stand and display this, a student in the strike as the student to and to declare

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,620
another student in the stands and just initialize a value for it and don't assign venue for name field,

39
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,080
go to the next line.

40
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,600
Define the variable light.

41
00:04:52,750 --> 00:05:07,390
Student three column equals the student and said just age by the age, for example 30 and involve the

42
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,790
instant method student.

43
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,790
Treat these Typekit.

44
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,370
Go to the next line and display this a student.

45
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:26,470
If the student three reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

46
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,010
Now we can see the output for students want.

47
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,130
We don't have initialize a student.

48
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:41,210
So after invoking Mr. Smith to the name and age fields value set to define value.

49
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:47,130
Means Robert and Tony fine for student two.

50
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:54,750
We don't have initialise age field, so after we walk ins transmittal the age feed value set different

51
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,060
value means Julia and twenty five and four student three.

52
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,270
We don't have initialise name field, so Anthony won't Mr. Smith, with the name field value set to

53
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:14,100
default value means Robert and Turkey, so he could assign default value for this tournament via a method.

54
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,560
OK.

55
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,010
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

56
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,000
the next session.

57
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,810
Goodbye.
