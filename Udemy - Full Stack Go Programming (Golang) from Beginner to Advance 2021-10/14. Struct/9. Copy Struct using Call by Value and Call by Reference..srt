00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,440
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,220
comparisons with the different values assigned to data fields.

3
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,750
And in this session, we want to talk about the authors abstract concept.

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:42,810
Copyists long time using venue on point to a reference as very ingo learning can be copied to another

5
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,410
variable, easily using the assignment a statement.

6
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,710
Any changes made to the second astronaut will not be reflected back to the first this rocket.

7
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,370
We use two ways to do this.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,440
First copy, boy value and second copy by reference.

9
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,650
Let's go to the school program to illustrate coppinger structure to another variable.

10
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,260
First, we want to talk about concubine value.

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,570
Create the astronaut named a student and cis variable for it.

12
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,170
Typekit.

13
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:36,260
The student just arrived declaring variables name is strange.

14
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,290
All right, marks and.

15
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:52,000
CC four and said the comment for the export business right to the list.

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,920
Now go to the main function,

17
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,530
creating an instance of the student assault type and initialize it for the example.

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,040
This to that one column equals the student.

19
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:29,940
For me, Julia, and for the March 19 display to create an instance if P is to the wrong color.

20
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:40,460
Student one now calling their strike the student to another variable by using the assignment operator

21
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,200
create an instance named student two and copious student.

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,850
Want inside it?

23
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,610
Go to the next line.

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,260
The student two color equals the student.

25
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:14,450
One displayed the created instance if p is student two column student to now list changing values of

26
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:29,840
a student to his right after copying, for example, the student to thoughts name equals Robert and

27
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:40,300
the student to dot marks equals ninety five now display to students after changing values.

28
00:03:41,450 --> 00:04:01,100
Go to the next line if be first, set a message this play to the students after changes go to the next

29
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:12,770
line if P is to that one column, so the student bombarded that and go to the next line.

30
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:26,450
FP student two column and simply of a student to OK, he formerly called Save the Project and run the

31
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,960
program.

32
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:36,430
Now we can see the out modifications are applied to the second instance made from the student shrunk,

33
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,440
and no changes are made to the first instance.

34
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,840
And we see a student tool by new values and student y by previous values.

35
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,980
Now, let's go to talk about copy by reference.

36
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,120
First, create a restaurant name person and sets variable for its first clear the last quote

37
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,130
Thai

38
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,100
person extract

39
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,030
declaring variables.

40
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:33,810
Name a string and I.D. and sixty four said the common or export this is right person construct go to

41
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:42,120
the main function, creating an instance of the person a stroke type and initialize is for the example

42
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,230
person.

43
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,250
One colon equals person

44
00:05:49,800 --> 00:06:05,700
four named gene and or I.D. one one two two three three display the created instance 50 per cent column

45
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,550
person one.

46
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,340
Now leave Francine this person to another variable by using the Ampersand operator.

47
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:26,520
Here it is the pointer to the restaurant for the example defined cursor by the named person to go to

48
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,510
the next line.

49
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,780
Person to call and equals Anderson.

50
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:46,950
Person one displayed the created in response if the person to call in person to.

51
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,910
Now that's changing value of person to a stroke after copy.

52
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:05,080
For the example, first to the name equals it, go to the next line.

53
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:18,720
Person two dots I.D. equals four four five five six six now displayed to students after changing values.

54
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:31,170
First set the message if they display two persons after changing.

55
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,930
Go to the next line.

56
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,100
If the person wrong.

57
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:49,650
And if the person to reformat the call, save the project and execute the program.

58
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,050
Now we can see the output in this case off point, a reference to the air strike down the line memory

59
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,640
location of the original strike and the pointer to the air strike will be the same.

60
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,020
And it changes made to the second.

61
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,980
The strike will be reflected in the first strike.

62
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,800
Also pointed to a strike is achieved by using the Ampersand operator.

63
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,300
It's allocated on the heat and its arteries is shaved.

64
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,020
OK, in order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content

65
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,100
in the next session.

66
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,790
Goodbye.
