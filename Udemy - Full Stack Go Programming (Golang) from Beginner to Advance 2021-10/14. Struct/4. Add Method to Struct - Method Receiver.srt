00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,470
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,740
missed that a start time and indecision.

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,160
We want to talk about the others a strong concept.

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,880
At metal twists, rock type, gold language support methods, gold metals are similar to go function

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,170
with one difference.

6
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,770
The missile contains a receiver argument in it with the help of the receiver argument.

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,010
The missile can access the properties off the receiver.

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,740
Here you are allowed to define the method whose receiver is off a strong tight.

9
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,010
This receiver is accessible inside the missile.

10
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,620
Now you can see the scene techs.

11
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,400
Let's go to this school program to illustrate how to create a receiver and a sort.

12
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,550
Watch it first, create the restaurant name author.

13
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:18,790
Time.

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:31,860
Also, the strike clearly raises and different fields for the restaurant like name, a strong

15
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,160
branch.

16
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,290
A string and salary, it

17
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,970
now create a method with a receiver of ozer type first four-inch keyboard.

18
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,160
Is

19
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,960
now set to extract valuable as receiver, for the example.

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,200
They also

21
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,890
then name a function show.

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,630
The practices we can set parameters and out of it, we can define a time.

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,870
In this case, we don't have parameters and return time.

24
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:35,920
Now go to jail broadcasts or otherwise by the receiver, Mr. Wood and write out statements, for the

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,160
example, displayed the only variables bills for dismissal.

26
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,450
FP.

27
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,700
Who serves?

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,530
Name

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,410
a dance.

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,720
Name.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,380
And AFP.

32
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,370
Branch.

33
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,370
Name.

34
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,200
Got branch and go to the next line.

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,730
FP.

36
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,520
Salary,

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,060
hey, thought site.

38
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:30,630
Before that, they called and say the project now, go to main function, create an old saw strike and

39
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,910
initialize it, then called the receiver

40
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,530
first, initializing the values of the old story structure, for example, resolved.

41
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,250
He calls also.

42
00:03:52,510 --> 00:04:02,560
Full name, value key and brands

43
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,180
C s e and salary

44
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,780
twenty nine, Tom.

45
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:30,310
Now, calling this show, my thought as a receiver isn't that show, please format the called save the

46
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,460
project and execute the program.

47
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,720
Now we can see the output.

48
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:46,760
We could define this right by three fields, then create a receiver method and assign it to also extract.

49
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,940
And in this method, displayed the values of OLSA properties, then involved the receiver method, the

50
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,580
main function and see the results.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,370
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

52
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,370
the next session.

53
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,960
Goodbye.
