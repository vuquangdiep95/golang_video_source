00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,780
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,820
methods bitcoin to a receiver.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,350
And in this session, we want to talk about the other destructive concept.

4
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,630
Metal can accept bonus points for earned value.

5
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:42,590
As we know that Ingo in function has a value argument, then it will only accept the values of the parameter.

6
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:50,120
And if you tried to pass a pointer to a value function, then it will not accept or vice versa.

7
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:59,620
But a gold medal can accept both value and point to whether it is defined with -- to or value receiver.

8
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:06,820
Now let's go to a school program to illustrate how the method can access -- and value.

9
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,150
First, create also a structure.

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,810
Time, oh, sir.

11
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:26,280
This rocket is set to variable name and branch name.

12
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,810
Strong words, branch.

13
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,540
A strange.

14
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:48,530
Oh, define the method with appoint a receiver of over time, fine, define a receiver a asterisk.

15
00:01:49,610 --> 00:02:03,050
Well, sir, sit a name like show volume and set parameter, a bench and a string.

16
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:16,530
Go to the metal and asterisk, a dance wrench equals a wrench.

17
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:27,420
In this case, we assign new branching old parents by them and create another method with the value

18
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,100
receiver of all serve time for the example font.

19
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,380
Value receiver, a wholesaler.

20
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,120
Sydney show two.

21
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:52,690
In this method, we set name filled of Ozer, a song by Julia enU, a dance name.

22
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,610
You called Julia.

23
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,360
And displayed Ayda Field name.

24
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,220
If he.

25
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,830
Well, sir.

26
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,210
Name.

27
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,980
He got to.

28
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,090
And through the message well before changing his plea.

29
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,080
Before.

30
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,140
And.

31
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,210
Reformat the code and save the project.

32
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,690
Now, go to main function and create an initialize and stands of old stories rocket.

33
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,750
Go to main function.

34
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,420
Define a very inner life result.

35
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,420
Calling equals also.

36
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,580
Name, King and branch

37
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,260
see is the disparate branch name before it moves the metals.

38
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,480
AFP.

39
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,670
Branch name before

40
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,210
calling it resolved that branch.

41
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:39,600
Go to the next line now, calling the show one metal or points or metal street value.

42
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,080
Resolve.

43
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,310
There are.

44
00:04:45,940 --> 00:05:00,070
So bound to set a new branch e c e go to the next line and display branch named after the show one method

45
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,480
FP.

46
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,020
Branch name after

47
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:22,270
changing reasons that branch through to the next line and now calling this show tone, method or volume,

48
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,060
it'll be the pointer of ampersand resolved.

49
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,200
Dot Show.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,160
Two and display the almost her name after calling Show Tomb.

51
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,620
It'll just be.

52
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,870
Oh, sir's name after.

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:06:02,860
Colin and resolved that may be 4Matic who saved the project and execute the program.

54
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,110
Now we can see the output.

55
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:15,570
Branch name is C s e before calling, so one middle and branch name is e c e.

56
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:23,490
After calling short one metal and Olson's name is Julia B. Forhim of the short two metal and ulcers

57
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:31,020
name is came after invoking the soul to metal, and we could see that metal can accept both very and

58
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,260
tones, or whether it's defined with points where value receiver in order not to prolong the time of

59
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,120
decision to be finished, and we will continue the content in the next session.

60
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,930
Goodbye.
