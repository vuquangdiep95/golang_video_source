00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,390
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:25,690
at twists, not type and indecision, we want to talk about the others the strongest concept.

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,750
Methods which point to a receiver.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,120
ENCODE language, you're allowed to create a metal with a pointer receiver.

5
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,610
With the hand of the pointer, a receiver, if a change made in the metal will reflect in the corner,

6
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,430
which is not possible with the value receiver, now you can see the scene techs.

7
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:59,080
Let's go to a school program to illustrate how to create a missile with point to a receiver.

8
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,850
First, create this right name, author Tom.

9
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:21,240
Also, restaurant celebrations, different fees for this restaurant like name, Estrange and branch.

10
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:34,220
Typekit is a strong OK now, create the metal with the receiver of Ozer tight as pointer defying fine.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,890
Set a receiver for ulcer tracked as a pointer, a asterisk, also undefined name for this matter.

12
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:57,300
For the example, it's sure and set a parameter like a branch type is a string.

13
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:10,020
Go to the caliber of a scythe, a statement for this matter, if you're asked to a dance branch equals

14
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,430
a branch.

15
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,430
In this case, the assigned new branch as a branch in all is Branch Med..

16
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:25,150
Now go to main function, create an ulcer restaurant and initialize it, then call the receiver method.

17
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:38,650
Initializing the values of the Old Service Trust, for example, resolved KOLLAN equals ozer name.

18
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,790
Rather and rash.

19
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:58,010
See this here first, this also his name and his branch names before the chance to go to the next line

20
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,750
p be for changing

21
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,690
FP.

22
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:15,830
Oh, search me, result that name.

23
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,420
And if he.

24
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,750
Oh, serves.

25
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,070
Rearrange the result.

26
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:41,560
And branch reform Atletico and save the project now, calling it point to go to the next line, define

27
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,540
a pointer like P Cullen equals and and person results.

28
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:59,380
Now, calling the show method and dispelling again OSU's name and branch names after the change, he

29
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,790
thought show and set a new branch criteria for the example, see?

30
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:14,260
And again, these fellow officers and branch name, he copy these lines and paste here.

31
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:21,880
After changing, reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

32
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,440
Now we can see the output.

33
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,910
We could define this wrong by two fields, then create a receiver and so and assign it to almost aristocats

34
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,600
pointer.

35
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,730
And in this metal set a new branch by table as a branch, then display author's name and branch names

36
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:49,480
before the invoke of method receiver and changes, then invokes the receiver mis-sold main function

37
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,020
and display in a game OSU's name and branch name after invoked the receiver method and see the branch

38
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:04,240
value has changed because we use from receiver method by the pointer items in order not to prolong the

39
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,260
time of decision.

40
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,580
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

41
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,480
Goodbye.
