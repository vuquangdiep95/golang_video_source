00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,210
Hello and welcome to the and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about assigned

2
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,820
default value for restaurant field.

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,320
And in this session, we want to talk about the others a strong concept.

4
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,910
Compare SARS with the different values assigned to data fields.

5
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,850
Airstrikes of the same time can be compared using calm person operator.

6
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:52,460
Let's go to the escort program to illustrate the concept of this strike competition by using equals

7
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,660
to operate or.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,040
First, define astronaut, named a student and sit feel for it

9
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,260
tied.

10
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:25,620
Just to the restaurant and set feels to me it's rude and age and sad comment for export at this war.

11
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,900
Now go to main function.

12
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,120
Creating two variables of A-student the structure and initialize them.

13
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,880
The student one column equals and the student's

14
00:01:48,030 --> 00:02:04,860
name key and age 27, and define second variable and initialize its same variable for the student to

15
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,230
call it equals the student.

16
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:20,320
And they came at age 20, sir.

17
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:30,550
Now checking if a student born is equal to a student to or not by using equals to operate or reformat,

18
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,850
the court said the project and go to the next line.

19
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:41,530
If the student long equals to student to

20
00:02:44,260 --> 00:03:05,860
print a message for us, if the variable is student, one is equal to that of the student to an adult's

21
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,860
coffee, this line

22
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:22,020
sat here and said is not equal to where even the student who can't reformat the code and save the prosaic

23
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,080
execute the program.

24
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,010
Do you the school?

25
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,730
Now we can see the output value.

26
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,510
Even a student vong is equal to variable.

27
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:42,490
A student to the two variables are equal to each other, and we could compare to a strike instance together.

28
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,250
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

29
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,330
the next session.

30
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,080
Goodbye.
