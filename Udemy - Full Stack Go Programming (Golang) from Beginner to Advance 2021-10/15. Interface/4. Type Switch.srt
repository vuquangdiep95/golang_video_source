00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,640
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,850
In the previous session, we talked about time, assertions and indecision.

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,010
We want to talk about the other interface concept.

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,060
Type suits.

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,690
In going Ingo Face plant sewage is used to compare the concrete type of an interface with the multiple

6
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,480
times pool wise in the case of statements.

7
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:53,030
It is similar to time assertions with only one difference i.e. Chase is testifying at times, not the

8
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,540
values.

9
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,470
You can also compare it tied to the interface type.

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,410
Let's go to this school program to illustrate how to use pipes which.

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:14,890
First, define a function that accept an argument as an entire face, for the example, following this

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,720
play, this a variable like a as any a face.

13
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:34,430
Now define Switch keyboard and a tie for using time switch.

14
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,530
Switch

15
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,540
A.

16
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,400
Don't open and close branches this time.

17
00:01:51,540 --> 00:02:05,970
Now set different cases for type of a variable, for the example case in Cologne and set a statement

18
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:14,280
for this case, for example, display type and value of a very that if air time

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:31,500
person to operate case dash, dash and value color person, the legislation and and set forth time a

20
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,190
and set for the value a dot or an enclosed prances is and set into value.

21
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,980
Save the project.

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,240
Now do these for a few other data types.

23
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,720
For the example that Chase S1

24
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:05,460
Cologne said the message copied this line and paste for S3 and sets the time for a to just ring

25
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,020
and said another case.

26
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:26,160
Case load 64 color and again paste the message and set time for a two float and sixty four and define

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,170
default for the case.

28
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,070
Then none of the data types are available.

29
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:43,560
Different color and set a message type not.

30
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:54,730
Now go to main function and involve the display function and send different values of different data

31
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:02,540
times to the missile, as our units say, if the project go to main launcher called display function

32
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:10,700
and set an integer value as arguing and first display, a hundred and twenty three go to the next line.

33
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:22,970
And the other case that the string value as argument display sit and let you go through training language,

34
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,530
go to the next line.

35
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:36,800
And the other case that the floats 64 value as argument display a hundred point fifty five and go to

36
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,670
the next line.

37
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:46,460
And the other case that the bool value as argument display set true value, reformat the code and save

38
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,560
the project, then execute the program.

39
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:58,880
Now we can see the output time and value one hundred and twenty three time history, value go programming,

40
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,370
language and time floats 64 in value is one hundred point fifty five for the fourth case means bullion.

41
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:14,810
When we call the display unit to missing the value of Boolean to the of the an argument since no case

42
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,970
is performed for the Boolean data time.

43
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,670
So the default case is call and see type, not found message.

44
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:30,050
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

45
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,070
the next session.

46
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,790
Goodbye.
