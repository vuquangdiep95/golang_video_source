00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,730
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,760
how to create and implement interfaces.

3
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,950
And in this session, we want to talk about the ideas interface concept.

4
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:41,250
Into either face type, the tide interface, open and close, Kelly Races is known as the empty interface,

5
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,200
and it is used to accept the values of any type then teen or face doesn't have any mascots that are

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,180
required to satisfy it.

7
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,840
And so every time satisfies its.

8
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,080
Let's go to this school program to illustrate how to use empty interface.

9
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,390
First, go.

10
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:16,430
Main function and define two variables by different times and assign them for the example that I ain't

11
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,140
equals a hundred and that.

12
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,670
Yes, that's true equals.

13
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,430
Hello.

14
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,920
Now go out of main function and create the function that has parameter as an empty interface.

15
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,590
Fine.

16
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,270
Set a name for the example kind

17
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,720
and set the perimeter as an empty interface I interface.

18
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,840
In body of metal, we want to see the value and type of arguments that pass from main function, so

19
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,490
be right.

20
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,590
If Earth.

21
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:23,040
The type of person the U.S. person T after case, said Congressman Caddick's, that the opportunities

22
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,070
for the time served valuable.

23
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:33,000
I ah again, I reformat the code and save the project.

24
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:41,460
Now go to main function and invoke, define kindness and post to created variables, as are humans to

25
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,440
eat and see the result.

26
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,530
Go to main function first coined by IBD.

27
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,000
The sad irony of it.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,110
And in the next line, you will find why this reform of the code save the project and execute the program.

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,000
Now we can see the output.

30
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,510
The time of 100 is ins and the type of halo is a swing.

31
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,600
Through the container phase.

32
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,880
We were able to send different values to our method.

33
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:26,130
For the example, even sent a type of integer and once a type of string to our metal, then viewed outputs.

34
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,670
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

35
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,690
the next session.

36
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,440
Goodbye.
