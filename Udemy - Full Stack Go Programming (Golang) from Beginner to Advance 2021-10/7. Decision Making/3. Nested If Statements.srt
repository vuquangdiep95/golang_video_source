00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:19,150
Hello and welcome to Golang programming language course in the previous session, we talked about if

2
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,570
as a statement and in this session, we want to talk about the other decision making concert.

3
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:39,500
This that if a statement, it is always legal in gold programming languages to nest, if Elsa statements,

4
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,690
which means you can use Von F or else if a statement inside another, if all else, if statements,

5
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:58,280
if the first condition evaluates to true, then the if block of condition one will execute and in the

6
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,130
first, if black, it exists and all that is blood.

7
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:11,630
So if the condition to value a value is true, also if luck of second condition will execute to now,

8
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,600
let's go to the escort program to illustrate how to use miss that if a statement.

9
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:31,250
First defined two variables like that a by the tight end and initialize it by 300 and define another

10
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:37,450
variable life via B by the time end and initialize eight point five hundred.

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,180
In this case, we want to write myth that if a statement so we right first condition is a equal equals

12
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,200
300.

13
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,970
So set a statement for the statement of this.

14
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:59,630
If like we want to check if condition is true, set another condition like Eve.

15
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,580
Be Equal Equal 500, so set in a statement.

16
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:23,840
FP value of a is three hand-reared and value of me is five hundred and go out of the that if block and

17
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,690
display the variable is A and B values.

18
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,130
So we write f f.

19
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:40,700
A you call first in the back explosion and said Avery Idle and go to the next line and display that

20
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,990
b variable value, so be right if F.

21
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,940
Be value.

22
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:58,500
Colin Firth and D and set B value watching reform at the court, saved the project and executed the

23
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,780
program, now go to terminal and run the program by the common goal.

24
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,670
Ron Duck's back as this may not go.

25
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:14,280
Now we can see the output value of a is 300 and value of 500.

26
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,890
A value is 300.

27
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,690
B values five times the value of the variable A is 300.

28
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,510
So the first condition, a value is true value and compiler girl to execute.

29
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,860
The first is block.

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,020
In this block, it exists.

31
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,630
Another condition that evaluates true because Variable B has 500 value.

32
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,790
So the statements inside the second, if below, are executed and printed.

33
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,890
The message value of a is 300 and the value of B is five hundred.

34
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,340
When the compiler go out from the first div block, it will be executed to print F function.

35
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,940
A value is 300 and P values five hundred.

36
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,080
In this case, we could define this that if statement, in order not to prolong the time of decision,

37
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,040
we will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

38
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,760
Goodbye.
