00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,940
Hello and welcome to go blank or get on a language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,690
We talked about Aether statement and in this session, we want to talk about the others decision making

3
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,320
concept.

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:38,170
If as a statement, the if a statement alarm tells us that if a condition is true, it will execute

5
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,640
a block of statements.

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,390
And if the condition is false, it won't.

7
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,700
But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false?

8
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,440
Here comes the Elsa statement.

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,090
We can use the Elsa statement with if a statement to execute a block of court when the condition is

10
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,660
false.

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,700
Now you can see the flow diagram of if, as the statement.

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,450
If the condition evaluates to true, then the if block of code will be executed and if the condition

13
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,620
evaluates to false, then the LC block of code is executed.

14
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,550
Now let's go to these schools for a get on and illustrate how to use, if else, statement.

15
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,150
OK.

16
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,720
In this example, we want to print a message based on if Alice's statement first defined two variables

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:42,060
like that a by the tight and initialize 8.30 value and go to the next line and define, I know that

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:51,900
many of them like Bad B by the Time Inc and initialize it by 20 now right conditioned by if as a statement

19
00:01:51,990 --> 00:02:01,560
first defined if, like Eve, and set the condition a less than B so city statement, for example,

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,940
if b a value is less than.

21
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,730
Be that you.

22
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:23,690
And go out of your blood and sit as black, so right as open and close can the races and sit a statement

23
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:37,100
for this blood, for example, if p a value is greater than B value.

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,510
OK.

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,120
If the condition has a true value, so the if plug will be executed, otherwise the exploit will be

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,190
executed, reformat the code, save the project and execute the program, go to a terminal and run the

27
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,360
program by the comment.

28
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,710
Go round the back is this may go.

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,980
Now you can see the output.

30
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,380
A value is greater than the value.

31
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,060
The value of the variable A is greater than the value of the variable be.

32
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,240
It means throw greater than 20.

33
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:22,010
So our condition returns false value and the statesman's inside the LS block are executed and printed.

34
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,580
The message they value is greater than be value in order not to prolong the time of decision.

35
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,750
We will finish it and we'll continue the content in the next session.

36
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,440
Goodbye.
