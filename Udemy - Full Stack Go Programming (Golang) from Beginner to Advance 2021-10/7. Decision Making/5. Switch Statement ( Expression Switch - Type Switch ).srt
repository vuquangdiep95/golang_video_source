00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,500
Hello and welcome to go dang programming language course in that part of your session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,300
Eve as if else statement and indecision.

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,810
We want to talk about the author's decision making consent.

4
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,970
So it's a statement as such, a statement is a multiday branch statement.

5
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:46,040
It provides an efficient way to transfer the execution to different parts of the code based on the value

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:56,780
also called case of the expression GO language support two types of seizure statements first, expressions

7
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:06,500
to each and second type such expressions, which is similar to such a statement in C or C++ or Java

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,100
language.

9
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:14,870
It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,720
Now you can see the syntax.

11
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,600
Let's go to this school and illustrate how to use such a statement.

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:37,640
In this example, we want to assign a number to each day of the week and implement it through the expression

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,150
search.

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,690
First, define a variable like today.

15
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:48,200
So we write that today by the tight end and initialize it by two.

16
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,490
Now write the switch case on the two day variable.

17
00:01:52,670 --> 00:02:00,860
So we write to each week and close Kelly races and define Chase.

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,550
For example, for the first case, we assign one menu for two.

19
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,270
They vary a bit.

20
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,740
So we write Chase today equal equal one column.

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,110
And in this case, it is a statement for this case, for example.

22
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,930
AFP two day is Monday.

23
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,520
Go to the next line and define and other cases, for example, in chase today.

24
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,780
Equal equals to Colin.

25
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,920
Go to the next line.

26
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,590
And so their statement FP.

27
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,640
Tuesday is Tuesday.

28
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,360
Go to the next line.

29
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,750
Define another case.

30
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,600
Case today.

31
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:55,040
Equal, Equal three, Colin said this statement for this case, for example FP.

32
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,860
Tuesday is Wednesday.

33
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:13,430
And go to the next line and define another case, for example, shares today equal equals four column

34
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,910
call to the next line and set a statement for this case.

35
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,990
50 Today is Thursday.

36
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,470
Case.

37
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,270
Today he calls five column FP.

38
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,800
Tuesday is Friday.

39
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,290
And case.

40
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,550
To the.

41
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,760
Equals six Column V said in a statement like today is Saturday.

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,720
And case today equal equals seven.

43
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,320
So be right, FP.

44
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,540
Today is Sunday.

45
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:23,530
Change and go to the next line and define a default based solely right default and cities statement

46
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:32,470
for it, for example, FP value for today is in.

47
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,010
OK.

48
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,120
Reformat the cord, save the project and execute the program.

49
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,260
Now go to terminal and run the program where they can't go wrong, but I guess this man that go?

50
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,250
Now we can see the output today is Tuesday because we are sunk to value to two day variables, so compiler

51
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:02,340
executed the case that two day assigned by two value and the returns, the two day is Tuesday.

52
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,540
Now go to his lies and continue types, which tied switch is used.

53
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,680
Then you want to compare types in this search.

54
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,650
They chase contains the types which is going to compare with the tie present in the search expiration.

55
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,260
Now you can see the syntax.

56
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,960
Let's go to this school curriculum and illustrate how to use types which.

57
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,290
First, define an empty interface that has industry value.

58
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:42,660
So you write that define a and like value by the tight end to interface

59
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:54,740
and initialize it by a string value, for example, go through or any language.

60
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:07,650
Now, go to the next line and define a switch case to find out the interface type, so the right switch

61
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,100
you find a variable like a column equals.

62
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,580
Value door, open and close parenthesis and sit tight for it,

63
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,330
open and close curly braces.

64
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,780
Now define Chasez to check the condition.

65
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,640
In this case, we put date or time.

66
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:45,300
For example, if time is an integer, so be right case in 64 case in 64 colour and set a statement for

67
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,430
this case, for example FP.

68
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:55,130
Time is integer column and set variable.

69
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,640
A go to the next line and define and other cases.

70
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:08,190
For example, type of floating point numbers override case floats 64 column and said a statement for

71
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,390
this case if FP.

72
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:21,400
Typekit is Lord Colin and said Set had a go to the next time and defined as string tied, for example,

73
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:35,700
case history, Colin and said a statement for this case, F.P. time is history, colour and said value

74
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,420
than a F-Type is other than these three.

75
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:48,370
We define default keyboard, so go to the next line and define default keyboard Colin and said a statement

76
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,230
for this FP.

77
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:59,390
Time is on reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

78
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,530
Now, go to turn on and run the program by the command.

79
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,370
Go run thought back.

80
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,920
Does this mean that go?

81
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,600
Now we can see the output type is strong and values go programming language because we initialize antinori

82
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,750
face value by issuing tide, so extreme case has returned for us.

83
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,930
We have reached the end of decision.

84
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,910
I hope you take full advantage of this session until next session.

85
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,390
Goodbye.
