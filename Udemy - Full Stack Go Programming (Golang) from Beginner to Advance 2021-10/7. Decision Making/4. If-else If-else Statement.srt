Hello and welcome to Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,510
In the previous session, we talked about Nest that if a statement and in this session, we want to

3
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,420
talk about the other's decision making concept.

4
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:38,500
If else, if else, a statement that if and if as the statement allows to combine multiple, if else

5
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:47,220
statements, the if the statements are executed from the top down as soon as one of the conditions controlling

6
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,290
the if is true, the statement associated with that if is executed and the rest of the latter is bypassed.

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,450
If now, if the condition is true, then the final as the statement will be executed.

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:09,830
Now you can see the flow diagram for Eve, as if else statement, then throwing it on Ron's first computer

9
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:17,330
checks, if condition, then if it is evaluated as true, the body of if condition will execute.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,170
Otherwise, the compiler will go to as if condition and check the value of it.

11
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,320
In this case, if it is evaluated as true, the compiler will execute the body of ElSaffar statement.

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:38,090
Otherwise, the compiler will go to either as if plaques if own, as if a statements would be evaluated

13
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,990
as false, then as block will be executed fine.

14
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:50,330
Now let's go to a school program to illustrate how to use from if an if else statement.

15
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:58,670
In this case, we defined two variables by the same values, for example, that a by the tight end and

16
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:07,280
initialize it by 100 and define another variable like that be by the tight end and initialize it by

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,390
100 again.

18
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,670
Now we want to write, if else even else statement.

19
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:27,020
So first, define if condition is a less than be, so go to calibrate, says and write a statement for

20
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,800
this condition.

21
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:36,830
So we write FP, a value is less than be value

22
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,280
and go out of the f block condition and define it as if condition.

23
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:52,250
So we write as eve and define condition for display.

24
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,410
For example, a equal equals b go to charity braces and set a statement for this condition.

25
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:09,380
For example, FP a value is equal p value.

26
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,380
And go out of the Earth if black and defined as black.

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,770
So we ride as and set a statement for this black soldier, right?

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:37,730
AFP A value is greater, then be that, OK, reformat the court, save the project and execute the program.

29
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,140
So go to terminal and run program by the command.

30
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,520
Go Run Duct Backslash Main Duct Go.

31
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,690
Now we can see the output.

32
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,610
A value is equal.

33
00:03:52,610 --> 00:04:00,170
Be value in this example because Variable A. and Variable B have the same values.

34
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,430
So the else, if black will be executed, OK, we could define Eve as if else the statement.

35
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,280
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

36
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,150
the next session.

37
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,750
Goodbye.
