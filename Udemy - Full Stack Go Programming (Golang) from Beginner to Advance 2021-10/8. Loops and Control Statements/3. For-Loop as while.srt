00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,140
Hello and welcome to goal and programming language course.

2
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,240
In the previous session, we talked about for Loop at Infinite Loop and Indecision.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,920
We want to talk about the other loops and control statements.

4
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:39,450
For Luke as vile Luke A for Luke can ask the world as a vine Luke, this loop is executed until the

5
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,950
given condition is true.

6
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,420
When the value of the given condition is false, the loop ends.

7
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,320
Now you can see the scene techs.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,210
Let's go to this school program to illustrate how to use Follow-Up as a white loop.

9
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,730
First, define a variable as loop initialization, for example, define a variable like PI column equals

10
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,430
and initialize it by one.

11
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,080
Now define loop at sit and condition.

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,290
Four.

13
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:23,490
Terminate it, for example, for set condition I less than five open and close curly braces and write

14
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,690
the statements here.

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,520
For example, in this case, we want to print I variable value.

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,970
So we write FP I and go to the next line.

17
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,870
Now we must always increment the iterator here.

18
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:51,270
It's already a bit, so we write I + + OK, reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,500
Now go to terminal run the program by the comment Go round dot back.

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,380
This mean that go now we can see the output one two three four.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,810
In this example, we defined the variable named I and initialize it with the value of one.

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,600
And then as long as I is less than five, one unit is added to the variable I each time and we were

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,510
able to use the for loop as a vine loop.

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Also, the code block can be as many lines as you want.

25
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,240
In this example, it's just one line of code that gets repeated.

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,280
OK.

27
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,470
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

28
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,520
the next session.

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,180
Goodbye.
