Hello and welcome to godowns programming language course.

2
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,140
In the previous session, we talked about Braekhus statement, and in this session, we want to talk

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,510
about the others control statements.

4
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,580
Continuous statement, they continue in a statement and go programming language works somewhat like

5
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,630
a break, a statement.

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,100
Instead of forcing termination, a continuous statement force is the next iteration of the loop to take

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:53,190
place as keeping any code in between in case of the for loop continuous statement calls is the conditional

8
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,120
test and increment portions of the loop to the Executive.

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,560
Now you can see this syntax.

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,750
Let's go to escort Brian to illustrate how to use of continuous statements.

11
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,200
First, define a variable named X and initialized by zero value.

12
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:24,940
So we write that X by the Typekit equals zero.

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,850
Create a loop that works as a vie loop and define the condition, and progress will continue as long

14
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,790
as the value of X is less than eight.

15
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,350
Print value of X valuable indent and one unit two x value.

16
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,690
Now do the following.

17
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:53,530
So first, define the loop for by the condition x list and eight open and close curly braces and write

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,940
our statements here.

19
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:04,810
Now, in four blocks, we define and f block and said if x equal equals five value added to value to

20
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,060
X and continue the for loop.

21
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,580
So we write if X equals equals to five.

22
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:23,890
So let's get two iterations E X equals X plus two and continue this statement.

23
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,110
Go out of the if lots and display the value of X.

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:46,060
So we write f f value is per cent d and set the back stretch in and set the X value the end after each.

25
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,240
The iterate the east value, then one by one.

26
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,800
All right, x plus plus reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

27
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,960
Now go to terminal and wrong go wrong.

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,830
The back.

29
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:16,030
Is this mean that go now we can see the output value is zero one two three four and value seven, and

30
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,790
we don't see values five and six.

31
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,730
The program runs at each time.

32
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,840
First print the value of the variable X and then adds one unit to Variable X until the value of the

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
X equals five.

34
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,980
In this case, the program into the F block and executes the comment inside the F Black and X two units

35
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:47,170
to each variable and jumps from two reputation in skips to value five and CS and the continuum for loop.

36
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,560
In order not to put a line in the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content

37
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,730
in the next session.

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,420
Goodbye.
