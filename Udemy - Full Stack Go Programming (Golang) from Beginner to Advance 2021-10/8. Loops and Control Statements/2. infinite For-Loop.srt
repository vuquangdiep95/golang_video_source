00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,490
Hello and welcome to Golang programming language course in the independent musician, we talked about

2
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:26,060
simple for loop, and in this session, we want to talk about the ideas, loops and control statements.

3
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:39,590
For Loop as Infinite Loop A For Loop is also used as infinite loop by removing all the three excursions

4
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,670
from the for loop.

5
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,600
When the user did not write conditional statement info loop, it means the conditional statement is

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,780
true and the loop goes into an infinite loop.

7
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,840
Now you can see the syntax.

8
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,340
Let's go to this code paragraph to illustrate how to use of an infinite loop.

9
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,950
In this case, we want to define an infinite loop and create a message.

10
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:14,480
So we write for without any expression, open and curly braces and put our statements in curly braces.

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:26,930
So we write FP, go through training language, reformat the cool, save the project and execute the

12
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,470
program.

13
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,640
So go to terminal and run the program by the comment.

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,650
Go round the back.

15
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,240
Is this man go?

16
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,200
Now we can see the output.

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,750
We could print and go programming language.

18
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,270
And this loop continues infinitely.

19
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,910
So precise control plus C buttons to terminate the execution of programming.

20
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,470
OK.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,010
In order now to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

22
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,210
the next session.

23
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,990
Goodbye.
