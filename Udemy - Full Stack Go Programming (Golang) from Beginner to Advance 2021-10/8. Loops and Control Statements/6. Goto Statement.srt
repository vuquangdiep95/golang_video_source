00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,960
Hello and welcome to go down to the academy language course in the preview session, we talked about

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,980
continuous statements and indecision.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,900
We want to talk about the others controversial statements.

4
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:36,660
Go to a statement to go to your statement and go programming language channel wise and unconditional

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,460
jump from the Go two to a labelled the statement in the same function.

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,800
Use of go to a statement is highly discouraged in any programming language because it becomes difficult

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,420
to trace the comfort flow of the program, making the program difficult to understand and modify any

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,920
program that uses a go to can be written using some other construct.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,130
Now you can see the syntax

10
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,340
here.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:17,250
Label can be any plain text except go keyword, and it can be set anywhere and go program above or below

12
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,510
to go to a statement.

13
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,950
Now let's go to this school with Cary Grant to illustrate how to use love, go to a statement.

14
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:37,900
First, define a variable named X and initialize it by zero values, so we write that X by the tight

15
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:47,170
end and initialize it by zero value, create a loop that works as a y loop and define the condition

16
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:54,910
and programmable continues as long as the value of X is less than eight and print value of X variable

17
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,190
and then add one unique to X variable.

18
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,010
Now do the following.

19
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:11,320
First, define a label like labor long labor while column and go to the next line and define a value

20
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,130
loop, so write for and set conditions.

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,780
In this case, it's less than eight or 10 in curly braces.

22
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,150
And write our statement here.

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,280
Now define our if luck solved right each.

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,400
For example, it's equal, equal five cities statement for this.

25
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:44,440
If like, for example, an X equals X plus one and now using go to statements, all right.

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,580
Go to label one.

27
00:02:49,540 --> 00:03:02,860
And now go out of each block and displayed the very and sort of write f f value of X column first,

28
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,060
then d back in and said, expand it.

29
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:19,140
And in the next line, E-Trade, our biggest variable, one by one, all of Ryan Giggs plus plus okay,

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,260
in four block, we define and if plug in set, if it's equally equal, five value add one value two

31
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,790
x and go to two the label one position and continue the program.

32
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,560
OK, leave for medical, save the project and execute the program.

33
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,640
So go to terminal and run the program by the comment.

34
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,390
Go from thought back to made that go.

35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:54,980
OK, now we can see the output value of X is zero one two three four six seven.

36
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,500
And we can see the value of X equals five.

37
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:07,990
The program runs and it's time first place the value of the X variable and then adds one unit to the

38
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,440
variable X until the value of X equals five.

39
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,530
In this case, the program enters the FBI and executes the commands inside the block and adds one units

40
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:28,540
to east and jumps from one reputation and skips the value five and then go to the first of loop and

41
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,880
check the value of X and continue.

42
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,760
So we could define go to a statement.

43
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,190
We have reached end of decision.

44
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,330
I hope you take full advantage of this session until next edition.

45
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,990
Goodbye.
