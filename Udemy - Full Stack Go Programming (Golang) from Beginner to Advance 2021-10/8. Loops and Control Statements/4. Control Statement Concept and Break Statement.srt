Hello and welcome to goal and programming language course.

2
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,740
In the previous session, we talked about for loop as via loop, and in this session we want to talk

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,800
about the others loops and control statements.

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,070
Loop control statements in gold language loop control statements.

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,240
Change and execution from its normal sequence when an execution leaves its scope.

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,550
All automatic objects that were created in debtor's school are destroyed.

7
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,150
The gold language supports three types of loop control statements.

8
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,070
Break a statement.

9
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,320
Continue the statement and go to a statement.

10
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:17,870
Break a statement, the break is statement and go programming language has the following two usages.

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,910
First, when a break, a statement is encountered inside the loop, the loop is immediately terminated

12
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,070
and the program control resumes at the next the statement following the loop.

13
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,280
Second, it can be used to terminate a chase in such a statement.

14
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,390
If you are using nested loops, the break a statement will stop the execution of the innermost Luke

15
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,500
in a start executing the next line of code after the block.

16
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,010
Now you can see the syntax.

17
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,770
Let's go to this school program to illustrate how to use a public statement.

18
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:13,760
First, define a for loop and print zero on for solving right, for defining a variable.

19
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:21,130
I call them equals and initialize it by zero value semicolon set condition.

20
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,690
I less than five and set increments.

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,350
All right.

22
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,800
I + + open and curly braces and write our statements here.

23
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,580
In this case, we want to display our variable value.

24
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,190
So bright FP I.

25
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,390
Now define that look breaks, then the value of I equals three.

26
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,140
So go to the next line, define the condition if I equals equals three.

27
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,350
So you want to set that break a statement?

28
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:01,640
OK.

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,210
Reformat the call, save the project and execute the program.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,650
So go to terminal and run the program by the comment go round thoughts back.

31
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,440
Is this mean that go?

32
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,530
Now we can see the output in this example.

33
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,820
We defined the for loop that is thought from zero until as long as I is less than five and one unit

34
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,780
is added to the variable I each time and preen the value of I variable and defined the break point where

35
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,250
I equals three.

36
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:44,470
So then I variable values three for looking broken so we can no longer display the value four and the

37
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,610
program exit from the bloc in order not to prolong the time of decision.

38
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,380
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

39
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,040
Goodbye.
