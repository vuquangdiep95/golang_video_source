1
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,410
Head on over to the golden programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,350
We talked about truncate map.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,390
And in this session, we want to talk about the other maps concept.

4
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:40,630
Marriage maps, the keys and values of second map getting added in first maps now go to Waskow to illustrate

5
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,430
how to merge maps together.

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:57,760
First, create all my babies and initialise, then follow the example first, Colin equals man eat and

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,760
string and initialize it and column.

8
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,090
In

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:18,230
20, one g and 30, Colin Alex

10
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:36,590
and define another map, the second column, because no sit in, sits history as value times and visualize

11
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:46,820
it 40 columns, rather 20 column jean,

12
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,910
50 column Julia

13
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,560
and 60 column.

14
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,000
For the example, the

15
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:11,120
now use of fold in second map Marie and put the value of second body that in first the by the following

16
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,060
code full on Homer J.

17
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,480
Colin Equals range is secondary to the

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:35,180
first value of SITS index high and equals to G.

19
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:53,660
Now, peacefully, the elements of First Man Labor Pool I J Colin equals wrench in the first radiator

20
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,500
display all elements that is index rather.

21
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,610
Per cent, the.

22
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,660
Right is less T for space between index and value and value.

23
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:19,070
This thing is back in session and sit there validated I and G.

24
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,250
T Gold said the project and execute the program.

25
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:33,660
Now we can see the output and we could add second variable elements in the first variable elements.

26
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,190
We have reached the end of decision.

27
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,440
I hope you have taken full advantage of this decision until next session.

28
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,150
Goodbye.
