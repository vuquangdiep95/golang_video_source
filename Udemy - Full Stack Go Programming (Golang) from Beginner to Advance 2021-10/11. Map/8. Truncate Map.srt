00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,810
Hello and welcome to the Golang program language course in the previous session, we talked about sort

2
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,460
map and in decision, we want to talk about the others map concept.

3
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:35,690
TRUNCATE map, there are two methods to clear all items from a map.

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:45,980
First, remove all keys via the falou and second define the make function for the existing map variables.

5
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,290
Now, go to this school to illustrate how to truncate map.

6
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,980
First, create a map and initialize it.

7
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,380
My map, call it equals map.

8
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:19,420
Said and as the index Typekit and said Estrange as a value target and initialize eight 10, Colin Keane,

9
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,710
20, calling June

10
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,920
30 Colin Alex

11
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:44,170
now displayed a created map variable for index

12
00:01:46,870 --> 00:02:05,470
comma value column equals rearrange my map and this spelling by the comment if if index first sent the

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,980
package city for a space between index and value value person.

14
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:24,250
Yes, and I can stash and set index and value

15
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,640
the format they call and say the project.

16
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:38,680
Now we want to delete all keys by full loop and delete function.

17
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:50,410
Go to the next line and Fold I column equals branch in my map

18
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,610
and delete

19
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,220
minor and set index.

20
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,090
I

21
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,060
now display my body will again be my map.

22
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,210
After deleting.

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,640
Go to the next line and see

24
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:28,150
my map, reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

25
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,270
Now we can see the output.

26
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:39,820
First, we display all elements of map and then truncate and display it, and we see on elements of

27
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,410
Map Body that have deleted.

28
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:51,980
In second method, we want to use make function to truncate the map barrier, but first clear the last

29
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,520
code.

30
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:02,450
And remove the delete function, create a very able and initialize it, display the elements of it.

31
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:15,400
In this case, we said make function right hand of existing, my body in my map equals me function said

32
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,670
eat as index and sit as string as value time.

33
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,310
Save the project and execute the code again.

34
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:32,190
Now we can see the output in this case also, we display all elements of math and then truncate map

35
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,940
variation by the main function and display it.

36
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,150
And we see all elements of map a bit have deleted in order not to prolong the time of decision.

37
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,810
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

38
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,370
Goodbye.
