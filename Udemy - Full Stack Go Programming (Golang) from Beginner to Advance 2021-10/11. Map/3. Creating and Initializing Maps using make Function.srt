00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,810
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,170
creating an initializing maps by sympathy.

3
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,610
And in this session, we want to talk about the authors map concept.

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,170
Creatine and initializing mass using make function.

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,840
You can also create a map using make function.

6
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,620
This function is an inbuilt function, and in dismissal, you just need to pass the time of the man

7
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,780
and it will return and initialized map.

8
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,310
You can see the syntax.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,870
Now, go to Waskow to illustrate how to create an initialise map using make function.

10
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,790
For the example, creating your map using may function to restore students at schools.

11
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,210
That my math.

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,780
Equals make function math.

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,560
He is estranged and value is flawed.

14
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:45,590
Sixty four, as we already know, that made function always returns in map, which is initialized so

15
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,420
we can add value in it.

16
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,310
Go to the next line my map

17
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,730
for the exam pad.

18
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:05,300
She is keen and value is eighty point fifty five.

19
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,590
Go to the next line and add another value.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:20,720
My map, for the example she is gene and value is ninety point thirty three.

21
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:33,870
Go to the next line and the other element my map for the example key is Robert's and value is 75 dot

22
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,850
60.

23
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,990
OK, reformat the code now.

24
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:54,590
Display the map elements FP, my my column and my map value, and save the project and execute the code.

25
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:06,010
Now we can see the output for S Score is eight point fifty five and GM is cool is ninety point three

26
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:06,710
and four.

27
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,460
Rather, its core is seventy five point sixty.

28
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,640
We could define the map for restoring the students is caused by the make function.

29
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:23,720
The student's name is stored in the map as index and there is cool as value in the map.

30
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,040
In order not prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in the

31
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,880
next session.

32
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,630
Goodbye.
