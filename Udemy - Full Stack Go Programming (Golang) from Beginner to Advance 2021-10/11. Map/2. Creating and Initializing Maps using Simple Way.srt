00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,210
Hello and welcome to the Go Line programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:27,260
We talked about Maps, a specification, and in this session we want to talk about the authors map concept.

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,500
Creating and initializing maps, you go language maps can create and initialize using two different

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:39,920
ways.

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,400
First, they simply.

6
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,890
In dismissal, you can simply create a mess using the given syntax.

7
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:59,820
You can see the syntax for creating an anti-matter, and you can see the creative map with key value

8
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,350
pair, by simple way.

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,470
In maps, there's zero value of the map is need and in need, map doesn't contain any key.

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,450
If you try to add a key value pair in the mean map, then the companion will through wrong time and

11
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:17,730
all.

12
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:26,200
Now, go to this school to illustrate how to create an initialized mass by a simple way.

13
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,850
OK.

14
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:42,830
First, create a project folder like maps and create a file like name the school, create package

15
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,390
and create main function.

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,080
First, define an antique map without initializing.

17
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:05,360
Now do the following code that and the map.

18
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
Equals map.

19
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:27,630
And telling it straight and without initializing now displayed a created map if the and to now and set

20
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,660
the barrier to entry A. Map now defined in Map Valley a bit and initialize it.

21
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:45,360
Go to the next line and create value for the example on my map equals map.

22
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,300
Keys in and values string.

23
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,350
Now initialize it for the example key is volume and values can then put a comma and right, are that

24
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,880
a key value pairs long?

25
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,580
Colin Quinn said comma to Colin

26
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:36,570
Jeanne said comma three column rather said comma four column gene and five column for the example to

27
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:47,200
add more and said the calm before might be called and display the created very even more map.

28
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:56,280
FP my know my ma.

29
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:06,030
We create two variable first empty map without initializing and second map by initializing.

30
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,340
And the key for it is int and the value of it is a string.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,370
Save the project, go to the terminal first clear screen, go to the folder projects, see the maps

32
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,430
and execute the project by the command, meaning that Google.

33
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,890
Now we can see the output for the anti-malaria vary a.

34
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,130
We have, Neal, because we don't initialize my variable able and for my map very a bit.

35
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:48,220
We have von keen to gene to rob her and fully game gene because we can duplicate the value and five

36
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,120
is at work.

37
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,310
Now we could define Ant-Man and creating an initializing and another map by simply.

38
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,520
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish it and we will continue the content in

39
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,360
the next session.

40
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,110
Goodbye.
