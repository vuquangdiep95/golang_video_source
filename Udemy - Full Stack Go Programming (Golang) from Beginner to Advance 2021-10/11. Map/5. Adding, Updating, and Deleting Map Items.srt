00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,390
Hello and welcome to the gold and programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,890
We want to talk about adding, updating and deleting items.

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,060
Act.

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,450
In maps, you're allowed to key value Perth in the initialized map using the given syntax.

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,390
Now you can see the syntax.

6
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,310
Update in maps.

7
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:51,220
If you try to end an already existing key, then it will simply overwrite or update the value of that

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,020
key within the nil value.

9
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:03,080
And delete the built in delete function, deletes an item from a given man associated with the provided

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,440
key.

11
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,770
You can see the syntax for delete function.

12
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:14,840
Now go to the school program to illustrate how to map adding, updating and deleting items.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,860
First, creating and initializing a map to a person's ideas.

14
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,170
My Mac.

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:44,560
Equals nap time index is in and value type is a string and initialized by values 10 column, 14

16
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,220
and 20 column for gene, said Comma.

17
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,580
Go to the next line 30 column for the rather

18
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,490
40 column value at long.

19
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:20,090
And the end element 50, Colin, and the value for the example of Sophia.

20
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,540
Now display the created math.

21
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:29,880
P

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,520
my ma I said that I needed my.

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,810
Reformat the code and save the causes first, we created man initialize it and display it now, adding

24
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,090
new key value pairs in the map.

25
00:02:51,870 --> 00:03:04,590
Go to the next line and follow the example in my mapped set index 60 and initialize it by the value

26
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,300
for the example jack.

27
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,040
Go to the next line and define another element.

28
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:21,690
My Map Set Index 70 and initialize it by Julia.

29
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,460
Go to the next line and display our map again because the map element has changed.

30
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:38,960
If P my map after adding.

31
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,740
New elements.

32
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,820
And sit my about it.

33
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,220
Before the call, save the project and execute, they could.

34
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,910
Now we can see the output before adding elements.

35
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,430
My map variables has values.

36
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,920
10 gene to gene church Robert, 44, and 50 Sophia.

37
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:25,630
And after adding two variables, my map variables has values 10 gene, 20 Gene 30 Robert, 48, want

38
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,290
50 Sufian and 60 Jack and 70 Julia.

39
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,220
Now we could add new items to our map.

40
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,520
Go to updating values of the map and initialize new values to existing index.

41
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,230
For example, in the 20s exist and we change its value.

42
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,150
Go to the code

43
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,870
my Mac Index 20 and change its values.

44
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:12,110
To follow the example Diego, go to the next line and again display the variable values FP Mind now,

45
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,680
after changing

46
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:27,350
values and set the values in my map, said the project.

47
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,600
An easy commute again.

48
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,860
Now we can see the output and we could change index to value from Jean to Diego.

49
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,980
Now go to delete an element from that.

50
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
Go to quote

51
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,390
now, use from delete function.

52
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,940
This function has two parameters.

53
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,090
First is name of your mat at second is index of element that you want to delete it for the example that

54
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:17,810
you want to remove Index 50 and its values from Mac go to display the man again.

55
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:32,180
This is my math after deleting Index 50 and certainly

56
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,920
reformat the code and say the project and execute again the program.

57
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,680
Now, we can't see the output index 50 and its value has deleted from our map.

58
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:51,900
Okay.

59
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,540
We could add new items in map update existing elements by index and delete existing elements by the

60
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,480
Delete Function Index in our map.

61
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,540
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we'll finish it and we will continue the content in the

62
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,380
next session.

63
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,040
Goodbye.
