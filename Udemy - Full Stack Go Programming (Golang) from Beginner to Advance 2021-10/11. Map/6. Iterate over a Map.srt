00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,270
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,690
map adding, updating and deleting items in this session.

3
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,440
We want to talk about the other maps concept.

4
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,160
Iterate over and map.

5
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:43,450
We can iterate the map using the range for loop, the value of this loop may vary because the map isn't

6
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,130
an old collection.

7
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,890
The four range loop a statement can be used to fetch the index an element of a map.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,010
Now, go to the school program to illustrate how to iterate the map using four inch loop.

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:10,800
First, create and initialize a map, for the example, in my Mac, Cullen equals map type of index

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:30,240
is each and type of value is strange and initialize for the example, 10 column chain, 20 column it

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,720
want

12
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,530
30 column, rather

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:53,630
40 column Alex and then 50 column daily.

14
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,040
Now, it's great, man, using full range lube.

15
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,080
So do the following Go

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,690
full sit I.D. for index a name for Value I.D..

17
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,710
Name calling.

18
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,910
He calls Grange.

19
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,220
My radiator, my Mac

20
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,140
and display I.D. a name for each element of Earth.

21
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:44,420
I the first and the back is legit for a space between idea and name and name person.

22
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:57,310
As lowercase and like this and said I.D. and name, reformat the code, save the project and execute

23
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,040
the program.

24
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,600
Now we can see the output, we could display and map elements by using four inch loop.

25
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,200
It is important to note that a map is an on ordered set and then the spinning element in it.

26
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,980
The elements may be displayed on order and output in order not to prolong the time of decision.

27
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,000
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,720
Goodbye.
