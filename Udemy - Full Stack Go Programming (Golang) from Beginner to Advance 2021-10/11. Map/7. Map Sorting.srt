00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,750
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,100
It talked about iterate over a map and indecision.

3
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,920
We want to talk about the idea maths concept.

4
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,820
Sold map keys.

5
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:42,250
Keys, east lies created with store keys, value of man and then sought to slice the soul to this lie

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,150
used to preen values of map in key order.

7
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,200
Now go to this school program to illustrate how to salt a map by cheese.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:10,500
First, create the map and initialize it, for the example on Seoul to mark calling equals to map index

9
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,890
type is dense and value.

10
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:23,280
Time is a strange and initialize the value of a 30 column change

11
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,610
50 Column G

12
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,510
40 column Alex,

13
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:50,430
20 Column Diego and End Element 10 column Jack.

14
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:03,440
Create this nice for eastern indexes of map, and the length of it is equal to length of map labor.

15
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:16,260
Now he's calling because lake function and set the time and

16
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,890
links zero and capacity east land

17
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,550
function on Seoul to map.

18
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,500
Now go to next line and append map keys in newest slice.

19
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,460
So do the following go.

20
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,370
I call him equals ranch in unsorted map

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,930
and he's

22
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,680
equal.

23
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,630
I pinched keys.

24
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:10,800
I reformat the call go to the next line and now sold Islamist by the sword package.

25
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:19,640
Because in this sample, keys are integers, so we use for information from sold, packaged to sorties

26
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,130
sold.

27
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,540
Hi Case got aids and said the very best.

28
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,200
He's

29
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,760
now E-Trade.

30
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:45,090
This lies elements go to the next line for indexes on their school and for the example, value quality

31
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,600
equals branch keys.

32
00:03:51,710 --> 00:04:08,190
And if the value comma salted Mac Index Value three, formerly called save the project and execute the

33
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,790
program.

34
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,360
Now we can see the output.

35
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:19,360
We could sort the map elements based on the keys by creating a slice.

36
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,340
OK, now go twist, Knight and continue.

37
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,290
Sold map values.

38
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,970
To sort the key values of a Mac, you need to restore them in its lines and then sort this slice.

39
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,550
Now go to this school to illustrate how to solve a man by values.

40
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,300
First, clear the last gold.

41
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,180
Create a map and initialize it for the example.

42
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:04,250
And so did my very best calling equals map index type is agent and value type string.

43
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:12,450
Initialize it now create this list for Essop values of map and the length of it is equal to length of

44
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,120
memory.

45
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:20,130
The values column equals Make

46
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,720
this three zero and learn.

47
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:41,170
And so that map now append map values in numerous lines through the following fold instead of index

48
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:50,380
said on school comma value plan equals ranch in sorted map

49
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,510
values

50
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,570
append values by value.

51
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,630
Now, salt is sliced by the salt packets because in these sample values are strings, so be used from

52
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:20,050
eastern expansion transport package salt dot strings and set the values.

53
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:29,170
Now, iterate this nice elements by the following code for the value.

54
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:41,480
Crawling equals range in values and display value.

55
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,740
Reformat the clothes, save the project and execute the program.

56
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,030
Now we can see the output.

57
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,760
We could sort the map elements based on the values by creating a slice.

58
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,270
OK.

59
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,510
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we finished and we will continue the content in the next

60
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,050
session.

61
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,770
Goodbye.
