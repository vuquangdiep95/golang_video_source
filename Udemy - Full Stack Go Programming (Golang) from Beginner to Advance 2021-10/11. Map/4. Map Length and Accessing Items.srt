00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,950
Hello and welcome to the goal and programming language course in the previous session, we talked about

2
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,490
creating and initializing a map variation by the make function and indecision decision.

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,220
We want to talk about the other maps concept.

4
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:43,550
Map links to determine how many items key value pairs a map has use built in land function.

5
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:51,770
Now you can see the sample go to this school to illustrate how to use built in land function.

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,750
For the example, creating a map using make function twist or employees marks and sit astride times

7
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:15,390
as index and sit in type as value, vash and fluid equals make function math.

8
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,460
This global markets sit history as index and sit end as value.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:37,770
Now go to the next line and initialize the Mac and Louis index, for example, keen and value is 10.

10
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:48,930
Go to the next line, and Louis, he is gene values 20.

11
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,820
And in the next line and another element employee.

12
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,200
Rather.

13
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,710
And value is 30.

14
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,090
And create a game empty map.

15
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,610
Go to the next line and Chloe

16
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,600
Beast.

17
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:34,870
Colin Equals make and map key is strange, and when is it now, Yvonne, to see length of to my variable

18
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:42,220
by the land function, first variable initialize and second variable don't initialize.

19
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:59,920
Go to the next line FP lend function for the employee and go to the next line if the using land function

20
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,840
for the employee list.

21
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,710
Reformat the code, save the project and execute the program.

22
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:20,630
Now we can see the output for employment, the length is three because it has three values and for the

23
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:27,740
employee list, the length is zero because it doesn't have any value and the learned function in return

24
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,710
zero for an undisclosed month.

25
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,910
Now go to his line and continue.

26
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:46,500
Accessing items, you can access the items of a map by referring to its key name inside Esquire brackets.

27
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,630
Now you can see the sandpit.

28
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,420
Go to this school to illustrate how to access map items.

29
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,990
First, clear the last quote.

30
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:13,050
Save the project, for the example, creating a map twist to a person's idea and sit and type as index

31
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:30,660
and string type as a value vase in pillowy equals map type index is in and value index is a string and

32
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,100
initialize the variable.

33
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,930
For the example, a hundred other

34
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:47,970
key and 200 dollar value is gene.

35
00:04:49,330 --> 00:05:02,410
And third element 300, Colin, and value is rather diplomatic coup and go to the next line.

36
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,230
Now you access the map items by calling in the Esquire brackets.

37
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,550
So do the following if he

38
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:25,000
said name of map and put the selected index in square brackets for the example employee escort brackets

39
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,070
and set the index for the Example 100, reformat the code and save the project, then execute the program.

40
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,180
Now we can see the output.

41
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,010
We put an index in square brackets and get the value of that index.

42
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,710
In this case, we set the hundred as index and the return chain as value.

43
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:55,990
Now we could define the map and access to its items in order not to prolong the time of decision will

44
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,160
finish it, and we will continue the content in the next session.

45
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,150
Goodbye.
