00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,580
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the pit of your session.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,830
We were able to implement a server part and in this session, we want to go to main function and use

3
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,600
from created server.

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,730
OK, now go to Project Explorer and create a main file.

5
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:43,080
You mean the go set package main and define main function.

6
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:54,310
But before main function, first we create an equivalent extract for the JS on file created at the beginning

7
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:00,460
of the project so that we can map that JSON file to the Golang equivalent data.

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,330
So the right time

9
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:23,650
configuration is to define a variable like server port by the time a string and set JSON tak

10
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,970
jason color.

11
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,900
Server for

12
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,840
now, go to the main function and open JSON file by the open function from OS package

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:55,300
first defined to variable file and call an equal and calling open function from worse package and set

14
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,110
config dot JSON file an argument for it.

15
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:10,120
Config dot js open function opens the named fine for reading if successful methods on the return file

16
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,530
can be used for reading.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,440
If there is an error, it will be of type Astrid's pass or now we check error status.

18
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:25,750
If error, you like the fatal error that.

19
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,610
Yeah.

20
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:42,130
Now we create an object from configuration, obstruct, define a variable like con calling equals new

21
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,610
configuration.

22
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:01,460
From Jason Package, the call new decoder and Sid Fine as arguments to it then called function insists

23
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:12,200
common variable as empty in their face value, but first define a variable like error equals Jason Dodd's

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,120
new decoder set.

25
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:24,290
Fire this argument and call decode and Sid confess argument for it.

26
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:32,960
In this case, the good function reads the next JSON encoded value from its input and installs it in

27
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,160
the value pointer to buy conf now check error status.

28
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:46,320
If error like that fatal error darts error.

29
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,130
Now call drums that metal from the VVIP package and pass the port silver value to it as an argument

30
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,890
before calling Fonctionnent first set a message FP wrong, sir.

31
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:23,240
Now cutting function with dart from there and sit set report as arguments to it by the carve object.

32
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:32,330
Reformat the court, save the project and execute the program, see the Jason

33
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,440
go wrong.

34
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,730
Dot backslash.

35
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,020
That's cool.

36
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:49,600
OK, now we can see server is running in this time we go to browser and enter defined address in JSON

37
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,640
file and we will see the server response go to the browser, enter a defined address in JSON.

38
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:07,330
Find in browser you are at low quarter past column 885 and press enter.

39
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,410
OK.

40
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,020
We can see the server response.

41
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,120
We could create a single server and send requests to it.

42
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,100
And for this purpose, we use Jason Phi and they got into coding data.

43
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,420
And in this project, we could use from JSON implementation.

44
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,380
We have reached the end of this session.

45
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,210
I hope you have taken full advantage of decision until next session.

46
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,860
Good bye.
