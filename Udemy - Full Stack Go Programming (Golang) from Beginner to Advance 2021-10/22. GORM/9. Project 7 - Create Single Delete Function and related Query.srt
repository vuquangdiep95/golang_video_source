00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,360
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,080
They could define multiple update function and in.

3
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,650
We want to create the function to delete a student in a student in an in-person database.

4
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,040
We want to do the delete operation in two ways.

5
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:38,600
First, for delete a student or a record of the student today and second for delete more than a student

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,240
record or many records in the student data.

7
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,820
Delete a student.

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,930
First, define the function named single.

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:54,800
Delete that accept a parameter that is an empty interface, which indicates that any instance of a strike

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,810
is to be passed to the this method.

11
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:03,710
Also, this function returns the number of records that have been affected by the delete operation at

12
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,760
the end of the works.

13
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,610
So go to the DB connection PHI and define our function.

14
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,800
Find singular delete.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,220
Set a name like object for empty interface object.

16
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,710
Either tied into and or face.

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,590
And return type is in sixty four.

18
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:49,820
Now calling connect function for initializing MySchool data source name, this function returns a DB

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,700
object from garden package.

20
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,100
So define a variable like DB calling equals and invoke connect function.

21
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:10,980
After creating a DV object from Gore and package, we invoked delete function so we can delete function

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,470
on the DBI object and Sith object instance, an argument for it before calling it first define a variable

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,390
like reason for the return type delete function.

24
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,860
Deletes value match given conditions if the value has primary key denville, including the primary key

25
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,970
as condition result column equals DB dot lead.

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,150
And said, Optic, there's argument to it.

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,640
When did it record, you need to ensure its primary field has value and Gorham will use the primary

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,900
key to delete the record?

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,010
If primary fields blank or invaded, did it are records for the model now invoking those affected field

30
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:13,450
from resolved return that we showed the remove the fact that records so be right ITR resolved dot rows

31
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,380
affects the format.

32
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:22,680
The code in SEC, the project we have now succeeded in designing a method to receive a strike instance

33
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,300
from the outside and delete this object from its table in database.

34
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,130
Now we go to the main function to use to this query statement.

35
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,690
First, clear the last code.

36
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,450
In this case, we want to delete a student in person database, so we should use from single digit functions

37
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,500
from TV tools.

38
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,400
Suppose a student with I.D. number two is in the database and we want to delete these records from a

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,320
student table in person database.

40
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,270
So first, go to my school database and see this record.

41
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,750
Now we can see the records of the student table in person database.

42
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,210
We want to remove the I.D. number two by the name Robert and age 25.

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,510
Now go to the school program and continue.

44
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,280
First, create an a student object from a student, etc. and initialize it value in it.

45
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,730
So override the student calling equals model dot student

46
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:44,370
and sit idly by two and now invoke delete function from TV tools.

47
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,760
Package and send create the student object argument and fist row effect it.

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:58,470
So first, define a variable like roll call equals calling single digit function from TV tools, TV

49
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,660
tools, dot single let and set a student instance.

50
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:24,650
Now this a return type as role variable, so right, FP Rose faked it and said roll reformat the code

51
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,390
and save the project, now execute the program.

52
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,800
Glow from the outback is the main main.

53
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,670
That's cool.

54
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,180
OK, now we can see the output rose affected one.

55
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,590
Now go to database again and execute silly query and see the changes executed.

56
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,460
Select query.

57
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:04,260
OK, we can see that a record of a student with I.D. number two was removed from table and one row is

58
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,730
affected in order not to prolong the time of decision.

59
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,210
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session until next session.

60
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,700
Goodbye.
