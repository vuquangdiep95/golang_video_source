00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,050
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course in the previous session.

2
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,650
We could create a select function that fits all members of a student table in person database.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,300
And in this case, we want to create a function to update a student in a student table in person database.

4
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,350
We want to do the opposite operation in two ways.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,450
First, for update a student or a record of a student data.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,910
And second for update more than a student record or many records in a student table.

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,640
First, we want to talk about update.

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,870
Students now go to DB connection fine.

9
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,280
First, define the function name single update form.

10
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:09,190
Single update this function accept two parameters.

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,330
First parameter is an AMD interface, which indicates that an instance of a strike is to be passed to

12
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,000
this method.

13
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,270
And second parameter is a map, which the update information is sent to the middle.

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:29,350
Also, this function returns the number of records that have been affected by the update operation at

15
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,340
the end of the watch.

16
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:44,140
So first set in name like object by the time and to interface, object and and interface set to come

17
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:57,070
on and sit a name like data for define and map data not set by the time jetstream.

18
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,910
And Sith value by the time empty in their face, because we don't know what time of the value was sent

19
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:14,260
to the function into interface and set N64 as a return type.

20
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,410
Now, Colin Connect function for initializing MySchool School DataSource name, this function returns

21
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:34,080
a DB object from goram packets, so define a variable like DB calling equals and calling conic function

22
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,550
after creating a DB object from quorum packets being what finite function?

23
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,300
This function acts as student instance, then running set query on the student table and fetching a

24
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,580
student from database and return it.

25
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:57,510
So the right DB don't find and sit object and argument.

26
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:10,050
Then declining model function from the object and Sith object instance as arguments for it before calling

27
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:17,070
it first define a variable like reason for the return type model function is specify the model you would

28
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,220
like to run operations, so be right.

29
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:31,530
Result calling equals and calling model function on DB object DB thought model and set object as argument

30
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,770
and more.

31
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,930
Invoke this function instead.

32
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,450
Data object as a map argument for it.

33
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,350
Updates function update attributes with callbacks, dot off days

34
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,560
and set data has argued date.

35
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,300
Now, invoking Groves affected field from resolved to return that we should update the fact that records

36
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:15,110
sold the right, Rita resolved that those affected OK, reformat the court and save the project.

37
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:22,460
We have now succeeded in designing a method to receive a strike instance from the outside and update

38
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,410
the values of descent object.

39
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:31,640
According to the values given the other maps sent now, go to the main function to use this query statement

40
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,820
first to your last court.

41
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,110
In this case, we want to opt it in new student in person database, so we should use from single update

42
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,820
function from DB tools.

43
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:54,170
Suppose a student with I.D. number one is the database and we want to change the name and age values

44
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,920
of it.

45
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,680
So create an a student object from a student district and initialize I.D. value in it.

46
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:13,220
A student calling equals model dot student and initialize I.D.

47
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,910
equals one and now define the map variable for send new data.

48
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,790
After opting for this instead.

49
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,690
So vraie data column equals map.

50
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,740
The time off key is estrange and the type of value is empty.

51
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,880
Interface.

52
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,060
Name

53
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,720
equals.

54
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,970
John?

55
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:00,770
And H equals forty.

56
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:14,410
Now calling update function from DevTools package and sent created a student object as first argument

57
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,250
and data.

58
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,550
A second argument to eat and fish row affected.

59
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,190
So first define a variable like row

60
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:39,070
column equals DevTools Dot single object and sit ampersand the student.

61
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,580
And said they'd.

62
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,080
And now display return time as roll variable.

63
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,730
So we write FP

64
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,810
roles affected and set variable low.

65
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:10,320
Before run the program, go to the database and see the values of name and age of ID number one.

66
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,420
We can see the ID number one name is changed and ages 20.

67
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,310
Go to the village school program and run the project go wrong.

68
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,890
Dot packets Maine and Maine dot gov.

69
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:40,400
Now we can see the output rose effect, it is one now go to the database again and executed select query

70
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,450
and see the changes.

71
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:51,860
OK, now we can see name and age of ex-student object is object correctly in the person database and

72
00:07:51,860 --> 00:08:01,700
one row is affected, i.e. the one name has changed to John and age has changed to 40 in order not to

73
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,230
prolong the time of decision.

74
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,190
We will finish, then we will continue the content in the next session.

75
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,970
Goodbye.
