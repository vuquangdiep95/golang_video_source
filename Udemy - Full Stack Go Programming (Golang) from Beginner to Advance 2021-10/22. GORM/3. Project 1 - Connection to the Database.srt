00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,190
Hello and welcome to the golden programming language course.

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:23,440
In the previous session, we could install gore and my school driver into project, so continue to create

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:33,580
a modern first go to Package Explorer and in Project Folder, create a folder named Model New Folder

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,800
and set a name like Modern.

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,030
In model folder, it create a file like named the student or go inside it because we are going to create

6
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,710
a structure equivalent to a student table in the MySchool database.

7
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:03,910
New find students that go so go to student file and create is not named a student with fields such as

8
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,880
fields east or inside the MySchool database.

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:24,310
First, that package model and create a strike named Student Time two that instruct.

10
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:44,350
Set to comment for this as an exporter, student, as student and defiant variables, I.D. and attack

11
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:51,400
for a field allows you to attach media information to the film, which can be secured using reflection.

12
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:59,320
Usually, it is used to provide transformation on highest ranked film is encoded to or decoded from

13
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,830
another format, but you can use it to restore whatever metal info you want to, either intended for

14
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,440
another package or for your own use.

15
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:15,760
So in this case, we use from all our intact for these films, for the example for Aida.

16
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,730
We write, set, go on and take back to each

17
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,050
go our own

18
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:33,970
column, double quotation mark and set primary.

19
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,850
Underscore key, so said primary key attribute for IED I.D.

20
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:56,090
and name five is estranged and said contact back Dick Gore and Colin.

21
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:06,380
Double quotation, Mark Android N. Vaca,

22
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,300
50 semicolon not.

23
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:26,030
So said Eastern character numbers and not not a status for name and go to the next line and age type,

24
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:31,420
is it and set another and take.

25
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,570
Google are

26
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,180
calling double quotation mark and said, not not.

27
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,430
So it not not a status or AIDS field.

28
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,720
OK, reformat the code and save the project.

29
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,340
Now go to Project Folder and create another folder named like configuration, which is supposed to include

30
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,600
the settings for the connection of the Go program with the MySchool database.

31
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,720
New father can be Grecian.

32
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,560
We want to create a database connection settings as adjacent, so inside the configuration folder,

33
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:34,370
we create the file called config with the JSON extension, new Fong config, the JS.

34
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,440
The program requires Maine sitting to connect to the database that is data source name, data source

35
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,500
name is a combination of username, password and database name that we want to connect it.

36
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,580
So be right adjacent five four sittings off database

37
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,980
data.

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:16,810
Source named as key calling and set value, my database username is Ruth.

39
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,150
Colin and my database passport is or I can.

40
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:32,270
And that's why this slash and database name is person.

41
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:45,130
And set any configuration, so put a question mark end of database nine and right other settings, for

42
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:52,720
example, Chad set equals UTF eight.

43
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,690
Pass time.

44
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,470
Equals.

45
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,860
True and large

46
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,390
equals look.

47
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,940
Reformat the code and save the project.

48
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,620
Now he could create adjacent file for connection to my school database.

49
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:27,380
It's time to go to Project Folder and create another package like DB tools for connection to the database.

50
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:41,320
You Father DB tools and create the fine inside it, like deep connection that gold that contains metals

51
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,300
to interact with the data base.

52
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:58,540
New five DB connection that go before do anything first import guar and miniscule driver type of database

53
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,620
tools package.

54
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:06,010
So we write these two lines first package these tools

55
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,430
import.

56
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,860
Go on and I'll ask that score.

57
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:30,550
And in the next line, Quantum Dot, I'll ask the writer and slash why is it

58
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,150
OK for using datasource name?

59
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:43,180
First, define the global variable named datasource name as a string type that.

60
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:52,520
Data source name as a street type

61
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,190
now create an initialized function to be able to initialize this variable from other packages.

62
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:09,720
This method receives one value named data source name as input parameter and uses it to initialize the

63
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,340
global variable of package.

64
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,790
Until that, other functions can access their values.

65
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,130
So override function

66
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:33,660
DB initialize or set a variable like this, and by the time it is string and initialize the data source

67
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:40,140
named global variable data source name equals D is.

68
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,500
And

69
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:50,760
now we want to design the method who is task is to connect the program to the MySQL database and return

70
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,250
it to the object from our end package.

71
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,460
For example, we create the function named Connie that is stored by the lowercase character because

72
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,770
we want to use this function just to this package, and we don't use it to either package it.

73
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,730
So we right fine connect.

74
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:26,550
And return type is the object by the time of Mr. Gore and Dot DB, DB Asterisk, Gore and Dot the B.

75
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,550
OK.

76
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,490
They required Metro to connect to the database is the open function of the gore and package.

77
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:45,080
So we should import car and package open function opens, initialize the decision by its dialectal and

78
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:53,030
gore config option, and it returns a DB object of gore and error, as Stuart is the programming language

79
00:09:53,030 --> 00:10:00,010
used to talk to those databases, and each database product has its own variant of school.

80
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,060
So we call this variance in school.

81
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:12,320
Dialects first defined two variables like Debian Roller Derby, Croma, error calling equals and calling

82
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:21,380
open function from gore and package gore and dot open function.

83
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,790
And said, dialectal an option as input parameter for dialect parameter, we can't open function from

84
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,740
miniscule package and sit data source name as input parameter for it.

85
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:52,110
So we write minuscule thought open and set data, source name, data, source name, comma and forgotten

86
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,100
config option.

87
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,480
We write ampersand and select configure straight from gore and package.

88
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,440
Anderson Cooper and Dot can speak.

89
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:24,930
Now, check our status if error like that fatal error to enroll and return created TBE object as return

90
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:35,850
type returned DB reformat the call and say the project so we could define the database dialect for connecting

91
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,870
to a database.

92
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,660
In order not to prolong the time of decision, we will finish you, then we will continue the content

93
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,710
in the next session.

94
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,400
Goodbye.
