00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,630
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course in the previous session, we could define

2
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:24,980
to create the save method and insert some records into the database and in decision, we want to create

3
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,920
the function to select the statement, to fetch all the student records from person database.

4
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:42,110
So go to DB connection that go, find and define the function name select find.

5
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:43,940
Select

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,430
this function.

7
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:57,590
Accept a slice of A-student as parameter and retrieve all students of a student table in person database.

8
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:04,250
So we write a student's object as parameter to students.

9
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,850
A slice of mother law student.

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:25,690
Now cutting connect function for initializing MySchool data source name, this function returns a DB

11
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,880
object from gore and package.

12
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,940
So first, define a variable like DB calling equals and calling connect function.

13
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,280
After creating a DBI object from GLAA and package the Invoke Find function, this function, except

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,900
it is life of a student instance, then running said Aquarium is student table and feel a student's

15
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,840
life by fishing his students from a database and return it.

16
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,520
So we ride DB dot culling, find function and select a students.

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,250
Enter students.

18
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,900
Now we use the range blue to display each member in the student list.

19
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:27,610
So we write for on the school set a variable like a student, Cullen equals range in the student's.

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,430
And now calling printer functions from 50 pages to display each record.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,050
If Earth

22
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:53,810
now using Person B for a student I.D. and sit back A for creates space and person s for Essendon name

23
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:03,440
and a game that is thirsty and for a student age percent d and sit like this and to go to the new line

24
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:19,550
and set variables as student darts I.D., the student name and a student start page.

25
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,760
OK, reformat the coat and save the project.

26
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,620
Now we could create the function fonctionnent silhouette that fits all students.

27
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,450
It's time to go to the main function to use this query statement.

28
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,340
So go to the main file and go to the main function.

29
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,650
First, clear the last code.

30
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,050
In this case, we want to select honest students from person database, so first, create a slice of

31
00:03:52,170 --> 00:04:06,120
student is less than the student's slice of model of the student now cutting select function from debate

32
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:16,830
rules, package and pass students slice as arguments to eat daily tools, dot, select and pass students.

33
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:27,380
Reformat the court, save the project and execute the program, go run dot backsplash, Maine and Maine

34
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,100
that go.

35
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,620
Now we can see the output, all the students are displayed.

36
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:43,180
We could create a select function that fits all members of student data in person database in order

37
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,100
not to prolong the time of decision.

38
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,780
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session until next session.

39
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,310
Goodbye.
