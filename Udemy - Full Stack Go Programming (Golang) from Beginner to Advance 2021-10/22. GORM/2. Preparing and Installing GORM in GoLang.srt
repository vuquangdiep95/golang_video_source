00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,250
Hello and welcome to the Golang programming language course.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,860
In the previous session, we talked about gore, concept and indecision.

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,660
We want to do an example.

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,820
Go line carrot using gore in and my school database.

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,520
We are going to see an example program to learn how to do database operations using INGO programming

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,340
language by the gore and and my school.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,080
We have talked about Krait before, which is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and delete crud operations

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,230
or basic data manipulation of database.

9
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,800
In this example, we are going to create an interface as database front end to handle these operations.

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,850
We have a student that containing tated information like, i.e., name and age with this data.

11
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,390
We have to perform crop using Goram in my school.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,710
In previous sessions, we succeed to create a student table in the MySQL database and perform craft

13
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,240
on it.

14
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,060
So we use the same student table built into the MySQL database in previous sessions.

15
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,440
Within this project, to connect to the Go program by Go are in.

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:43,720
In stunning gore and in a stunning school driver, because in this tutorial he used gore and and minuscule

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,900
database Vini to install gore in and minuscule driver in our project.

18
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,960
So first, we should prepare and install Gore and MySchool driver.

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,980
Or in a stunning gore and go to the terminal and simply wrong these syntax.

20
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,170
Go get.

21
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:12,320
That's you, gore in that I snatched Guam and fought in a stunning MySchool driver.

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,940
Run this command.

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,190
Go get.

24
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,070
That's you, gore.

25
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,820
And that i o ss driver is that miles?

26
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,860
Let's go to this school program to implement these requirements tools.

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,760
First, go to Package Explorer and go to a source folder and create a project folder named like you

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,970
are in the new folder.

29
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,550
Go on in before creating anything.

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,870
There are two things as requirements to do.

31
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,220
First, installing gore in second you starting my school train.

32
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,010
So go to the terminal and simply wrong for you.

33
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,100
Stunning gore and city to

34
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,860
run this command.

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,850
Go get.

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,230
That's you!

37
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:19,220
Go on and O Islam school, ah, and and execute this command before starting the project, I install

38
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,200
these requirements after execute this comment and installation is completed.

39
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,940
Install my screwdriver.

40
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,890
So Ron, another command.

41
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,330
Go get gas, you

42
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,880
go out and dance.

43
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,820
I know it's not there, either.

44
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,910
It's like my school.

45
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,730
After installation is completed to install the settings, close the V escort program and open it again

46
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,940
in order not to prolong the time of decision.

47
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,810
We will finish youth and we will continue the content in the next session.

48
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,560
Goodbye.
