00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,620
Now let's go to desktop and see the get software shortcut.

54
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:02,600
So first run the gate tool to test the soft fit, we want to see the least of files and folders in the

55
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,610
current part to do this.

56
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,320
We use the less common.

57
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,480
Now we see that the software is installed chronically.

58
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:20,360
And this comment shows the least of all files and folders for us in the first Test that we managed to

59
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,300
this to get completely in the following.

60
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,430
We checked the CND or command prompt software in Windows.

61
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,050
So click on a Start button.

62
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,110
Type C mode and select command prompt here.

63
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:42,260
As in the previous system, we can see the files and folders in the current path to check the software

64
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,820
in the Windows Terminal.

65
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:52,460
The DJR Command is used to view the files and folders, so we tidy I R and press enter.

66
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,490
Now we see that everything is correct and all the files and folders in the current pack are displayed

67
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,870
to us correctly.

68
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,530
Now it's time to move on to in the styling go language.

69
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,690

and we click on the finish button.

84
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,780
Now we were able to install the Golang programming language.

85
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:54,160
In this time, you need to define a path as a workspace for the go link, which we usually selected

86
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,970
by default.

87
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,020
See Backslash User Package.

88
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:06,640

Go to Hamid Reza.

93
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,920
Create a folder.

94
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,580
Named Go.

95
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,580
Now in Go folder, we create these three folders.

96
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,030
First, create a folder name being.

97
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:44,490
Second, create a folder named PCGG and third create a folder named SIRC.

98
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,910
OK, here you want to examine it.

99
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:55,500
Challenge, open the CND program and check the version of the installed GO programming language with

100
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,000
the Go version comment, so click on the Start button.

101
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,070
Type CND and select command prompt.

102
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,120

Go version.

104
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,880
Here we see that the installed version of Golang is displayed.

105
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:27,310
But if the Go version command does not return any output, it means that we should set the environment

106
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,000
variables.

107
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,060
