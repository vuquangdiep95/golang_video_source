00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,710
Hello and welcome to the gold and programming language course in this session.

2
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,800
We want to talk about installing, go learning and preparing vis code I.D. in Windows.

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,960
Guide Tool Kit is a version control system.

4
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,300
We need it for two reasons.

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,190
First, many components of go land are distributed via gate.

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,020
And second, the Windows installer includes the terminal that makes it behave more like Unix operating

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,620
systems.

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:01:00,060
So download and install mice escaped from mice, escaped the gate hop that I or vending installer asked,

9
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,530
make sure to select use gate from the Windows Command prompt.

10
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,220
The terminal windows comes with a terminal called CND Dot X Z.

11
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:24,950
You can start it by click on the window button in typing CMT and then selecting its terminals are a

12
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,770
text drive interface to your computer.

13
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:36,230
You can enter commands by typing the comment and hitting into your computer will then execute the command

14
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,060
and display any results.

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:50,700
Go ahead and close it as we will be using a different terminal that comes bundled with my CS kit.

16
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,180
Clique is soft.

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:02,410
All programs guide and select Keith Bash Tina's answer allow you to manipulate files and folders on

18
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,270
your computer.

19
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,170
Your terminal starts in the working directory where you can release.

20
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:16,750
The folder contends with less change directories using CD, make directories using the air and remove

21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,980
files using are.

22
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,600
Go Lanc in this style, going is a compiled programming language.

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:37,260
So we need to install the go toolset, download and run the installer from Go Lang dot org slash dial

24
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:49,680
2's Windows Dash AMD64 dot MCI for 64 bit or Windows Dash 386 dot MSI for 32 bit version.

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,520
You'll probably want that 64 bit version.

26
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,070
Confirm that it worked by opening a new terminal and typing go version.

27
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,070
Now you should see the go version you installed.

28
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:18,250
Environment variables now set the environment variables right click on my PC and select properties,

29
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:26,410
choose the advanced system settings from the left side and click on environment variables as shown in

30
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,090
the below screenshots.

31
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,960
Click on path from the system variables and then click Edit.

32
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:43,240
So click new and then add the path with being directory where you'll have paste the Go folder.

33
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,820
Here we are editing the pack see column Baccus.

34
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,770
Let's go back to the screen and click OK, as shown in the below screenshots.

35
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:05,950
Now, create a new user variable, which tells Go, Come in, Virgo Lang, libraries are present.

36
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,820
For that, click a neon user variable, as shown in the below screenshot.

37
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:23,920
Now feel the variable names as go routes and variable value is the part of your Go Lang folder.

38
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,800
So here variable value is C column Backus.

39
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,170
Let's go after filling, click OK.

40
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,430
After that, click OK on environment variables and your setup is completed.

41
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:45,800
Now let's check the Golang version by using the common Go version, uncomment prompt and see the Golang

42
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,350
version.

43
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:54,570
So after completing the installation process, any idea or takes editor can be used to write goals and

44
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,940
codes and run them on the IED or the command prompt with the use of comment.

45
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,310
In this case, we want to install this code and write our courts and it.

46
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:19,060
Install visual Estadio code and extension download and install VSCO from the following link code dot

47
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,240
visual Estadio dot com slash download.

48
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:30,610
After the installation launch, VSCO opened the extensions marketplace by the Council Plus Shift, plus

49
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,950
its short key and then search go extension and install it.

50
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:48,310
After it opened the comment, followed by the control plus shift plus P Short G and run they go install

51
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,870
update tools comment.

52
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,330
And select all the go extensions listed here and install them.

53
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,520
Start coding.

54
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,700
Create a file like name.

55
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,550
Hello Dot.

56
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:14,520
Go in this code either by the following by default auto completion and formatting for quote saving or

57
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,120
enable.

58
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,170
That's great.

59
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:26,310
After created the fine, save it and go to the terminal and execute the following command Go run hello

60
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,060
dot go and you can see the Hello World message.

61
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,600
Now it's ready to writing our courts in order not to prolong the time of decision.

62
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,860
We will finish it and we will continue the content in the next session.

63
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,610
Goodbye.
