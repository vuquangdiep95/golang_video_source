1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,160
OK so we've reached the end of this course.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,460
This has been an unusual course for me but I've totally enjoyed it.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,770
Usually when I create a course I have a very clear much more clear idea of what the Course is going

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,810
to be about and where it's going.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,070
And this one has been really free form and also fun.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,180
I like having fun and all my classes but it's been fun in a different way.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,370
Just like I don't know where this is going.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,770
And so that's been really good.

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,390
A good time.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,940
But the primary thing I want to convey to you in this video is if you are watching this video you are

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,660
a unique individual.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,450
You are above and beyond average.

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,170
You have gone farther than most.

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:37,900
Go.

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,530
You're putting in the work to build the life you want.

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,480
At the beginning this course I spent some time talking about the importance of humanity and what it

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,020
takes to succeed as a student and also as an individual on life and having grit and persistence.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,600
And so I just want to commend you for working all the way through this course and adding this drop to

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,550
your bucket because drop by drop the bucket gets filled and persistently patiently.

20
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,900
You are bound to succeed.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,600
And hopefully I can even serve as a role model for that because all humans we are all human we are all

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,020
alike in the same way.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,790
We all have our our strengths and our weaknesses.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,070
We all have our hopes and our fears.

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,860
And we you know have things that we do well and don't do well and we can all improve if we work at learning.

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,090
And so hopefully I've even been taught some of that for you in this course because we went into territory

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,370
of which I knew very little about.

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,600
And so it's been great to collaborate with you Daniel and to be able to learn from you and to have been

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,620
a part of this course.

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,810
So I hope it's been a benefit to you.

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,560
And I just wanted to take a moment to congratulate you and tell you to pat yourself on the back because

32
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,380
you're doing what everybody on this planet should be doing.

33
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,830
We'll try to make a comparison about who's doing how much but you know the more we each individually

34
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:06,700
improve our own lives one person at a time you know that's making this entire world a better place.

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,680
So as that cliche goes but it's true.

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:18,030
You have anything you want to say to just maybe speaking to your success as a coder and how you've gotten

37
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,250
to where you've gotten or anything on say the students congratulate.

38
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,680
This is kind of like good job into the course.

39
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,790
I'm the one who gets a few so you can tell that humanities humanities background all the books and everything.

40
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,390
Yeah yeah.

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,180
No.

42
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,000
Congratulations on getting through it all.

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,990
There's a lot here and I know the GOP Tea Party at least was we we're kind of winging it a little bit

44
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,430
with very little preparation ahead of time.

45
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,100
And so if you manage to get through all that and you learn something great.

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,240
Congratulations.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,030
Yeah yeah.

48
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,360
And he got a little bit meaty there at the end so good job getting through the course we got a couple

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,350
more videos for you in the next video we're going to give you a few next steps where you can go after

50
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,940
this and and then we're also going to ask you to leave a review in the video after that.

51
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,340
That helps other students find the score.

52
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,140
So we'll see you in the next two videos.

53
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,390
Oh and if we we sometimes create roles so that video might still be coming for you so hopefully that

54
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,350
will leave you with a smile on your face.

55
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:17,630
All right.

56
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,310
See you the next few final videos.
