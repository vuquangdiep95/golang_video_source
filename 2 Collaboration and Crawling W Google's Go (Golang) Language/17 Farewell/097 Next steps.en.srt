1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,270
So next steps you could take after completing this course as Daniel and I are going to embark upon creating

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,670
yet another go course right after this one and it's going to have more web orientation.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm really striving to keep my courses shorter so somewhere under 15 hours and and so we're really working

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,670
on trying to break those courses up and there's a reason for that which maybe at some point I'll explain.

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,520
But take a look on this platform wherever you are finding this course.

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,510
Take a look under my account Todd McCloud or under Daniel Hoffman's account and see what other courses

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,670
we have out there and if you enjoyed this course Come join us in another course.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,910
We have courses on go programming that are coming.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,780
I also have a whole selection of courses covering other skills office applications soft skills meditation

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,210
and mindfulness have been something that's been important to me I want to do a bunch of courses on investing

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,820
because that's my traditional academic training.

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,140
Believe it or not was an economics business and finance and so that's something that eventually I want

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,920
to get to also.

14
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,110
But that's gonna be a little bit out but maybe they're done by now.

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,180
Go check out our accounts see what other classes are there are of ours.

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,340
Be a great next step to continue forwarding your skill fit skill set and keep learning.

17
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,240
Life is about growing if you're not growing you're dead or close to dead right.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,640
But all living things grow.

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,210
That's what that's what we're here to do.

20
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,750
So remember that and keep growing keep learning keep becoming better and improving and life's just going

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,830
to get better because yeah that's that's the way it goes and reference those introductory videos where

22
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,240
I talked about all that.

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,450
All right.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,620
So those are good next steps.

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,950
