1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,440
All right.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,960
So maybe the final maybe the second the final video on this course is just set.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,440
Please leave a review.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,830
Leaving review really helps other students find this course that's how algorithms work and search algorithms

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,180
like the look see how many reviews how many people went through the course all that stuff.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,610
So if you enjoyed the course please leave us a great review on the platform and if you have suggestions

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,560
for improvement I reference the contact information I provided in the previous video.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,030
My twitter or my email please send me those suggestions for improvement directly and I do enjoy and

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,830
appreciate hearing them I really believe in the collaborative spirit we all get better together and

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,550
that's a two way road.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:49,650
And so just to illustrate that one of the things I do in my courses now as I provide personal anecdotes

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,330
into my videos so that people who are in a rush don't have to sit through my stories of my friend Joe

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,300
or whoever.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,760
But you know I save those for the end of the video.

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,790
So I do take the feedback that I hear from students and make the courses even better.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,220
So if you have suggestions for making the courses even better.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,130
Definitely message me on Twitter or email me and and if you enjoyed this course we'd really appreciate

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,310
it if you leave us a great review because that helps other students find the course and then that just

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,040
makes everything better.

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,320
All right.

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,680
So thanks for taking this course and thanks for leaving a review if you enjoyed it.
