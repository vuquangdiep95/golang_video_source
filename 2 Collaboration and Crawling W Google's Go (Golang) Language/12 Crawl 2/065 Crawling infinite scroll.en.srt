1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,350
So now we're going to take a look at a second crawl solution Daniel put together and Daniel I've been

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,850
super impressed by the code the student has become the master and I really love the concept that we

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:18,320
all have multiple intelligences and and that together we're stronger than we are individually.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,000
And I could wax poetic about this for a long time as you probably heard me do in the past but I just

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,620
really love the solutions you created here and excited for you.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,210
Excited for you dear colleague friend fellow adventure in programming excited for you to see the solution

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,810
so take it away.

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,990
Daniel.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,760
Yeah so.

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:47,340
So we discovered on the first one kind of after running it that it only found 19 solution tweets because

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,600
the screen was an infinite scroll and so it wasn't able to actually get all off the page all at once.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,400
And so go call we didn't doesn't really have too much of it away to really solve that.

13
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,760
It's not going.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,180
It's not actually running a web server so it can't run the javascript.

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,320
When you scroll down enough to actually like load more stuff.

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,290
So for some sites this is the end.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,140
There's not really much you can do about it for Twitter though there ended up being a solution.

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,270
I do want to zoom in.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:30,440
Open up the dev tools and go to the Network tab and I refreshed the page so you can be loaded up and

20
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:39,210
I filter the Network tab to x H R which is basically requests that have happened not as part of creating

21
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:46,470
the page initially but of a script is making these requests way scroll down to the infinite scroll you

22
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,620
can see the requests the the Web browser is making to get the additional data and so if I click on one

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:00,610
of these requests I can actually examine the you URL that it's making the request to which has some

24
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,320
parameters.

25
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:09,670
After this question mark including one that's called Max position with a big long code on seconds so

26
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:16,570
you you got as you infinite scrolled you were looking at the network tab and you had it filtered for

27
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,480
X H.R. and then it was showing you the gets are coming through and then you clicked on the file is that

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,700
right.

29
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,010
Yeah.

30
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,840
And then are there any any anything on the line.

31
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,130
Okay.

32
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,020
Anything on the line.

33
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,070
And then over there it shows you the header and and so click on one of the requests and examine you

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,050
are also go.

35
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:42,500
So go over to the header go to headers area I'm just making notes here and then you examine you are

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,790
all sensible rats and you're looking at your request you were out here I can see is made up has a query

37
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,500
parameter after the question mark Yeah there's a several query parameters separated by the ampersand

38
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,550
but the one that seems to change when I click between multiple ones of these each one is basically the

39
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:10,210
same parameters except for Max position that sounds good and so Max position appears to be changing

40
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,670
every time to some new value but it's some value that I can't guess just by looking at it.

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,900
So it's gonna need some experimentation to actually figure out.

42
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:28,480
Besides this I also look at to see if I go over to Paramus I can actually see the parameter Firefox

43
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,580
at least has a brand's tab which shows the query string parameters in a nicer view.

44
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,850
I realize chrome probably has something similar somewhere too.

45
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,960
That's nice because when you click between them you could kind of really see the differences that Max

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,780
position changes.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,960
That's cool.

48
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:53,380
If so then the other thing to look at here immediately is response takes a while to actually load the

49
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:01,300
response see the response is Jason data and I can look at this I can see that the response here for

50
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:09,790
this middle of these three requests the browser made it's got a min position which this Min position

51
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:17,860
string matches the max version string for the very next call if I if I if I take this.

52
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:24,220
This main position string and I go over to the next call it makes and look in the parameter list this

53
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,330
Max position is an exact match so for each call it tells you with the max position is going to be for

54
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:41,460
your next call to kind of get more data a second it's so there's also it has more items she can tell

55
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,120
which is I think could be useful to say Oh I'm done I finished loading.

56
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,230
So this one versus over here this one has no more items.

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,340
All right so it looks promising you're looking at you're looking at men position looked promising in

58
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,630
Max position and then also has more items right.

59
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,150
Yep.

60
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,760
And.

61
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:09,350
And then the max position in Max positions and parameters becomes your main position in the next call.

62
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,380
So yeah your main position is what they Twitter gives me and I give that as Max this next call so they

63
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,570
give me I'm in position and then I give them that as an expedition.

64
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,560
OK.

65
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,510
So then the final thing they give that seems so they've got this new limb a little bit confused on that

66
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,200
so call 0 comes in and on the first call for scale on the first call.

67
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,160
So I don't I can't actually see a first very first call I've already got they've already got my prams

68
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,050
list already has a max for this shot ready.

69
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:47,140
OK but its response has a min position and it takes a while to flip over to a response tab for some

70
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,020
reason it has a main position and that's DC.

71
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:59,320
And so that men position there they go over to the next call down and I go to Paramus this is that it

72
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,010
comes your main position because your max position does until it makes sense.

73
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,530
It seems like so I think it's max would be the end of the last call which then become the men of the

74
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,480
next call.

75
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,730
I think it's more I'm not actually sure why they call it that just so happen to be what Twitter ended

76
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,350
up calling them.

77
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,490
So maybe it confuses people who are trying to do this.

78
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,300
Maybe.

79
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,880
Doesn't it seem kind of like more intuitively your max on your last call be your man on the next call.

80
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,250
Yeah somewhat.

81
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,450
Yeah.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,360
So the final thing that was looks interesting is this items H2 email which looked from a quick examination

83
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:43,520
just eyeballing it looks like the h email that gets put into this list directly so if I can just pass

84
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,300
this a shemale it's probably got the tweets that I'm looking for.

85
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,600
Oh nice.

86
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,940
So this is all.

87
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,150
So just just quick examining.

88
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:04,280
So one final thing I want to do before I do this is if I go back to this you or L here I'll just copy

89
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:12,510
the entire euro and I go search for a robot's t t value.

90
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,840
Save this for the next video.

91
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,330
I think that was a good video just crawling infinite scroll.

92
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:17,860
Okay.

93
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,320
Or you think robots he's pretty quick.

94
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,420
I like keeping things to concepts so that's that's crawling infinite scroll and inspecting the all the

95
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,860
information that's coming back as you scroll.

96
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,290
Using dev tools.

97
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,930
Anything you want to summarize about that or say more about that.

98
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:41,270
Not every page will have an understandable request response like some websites will basically are unprofitable

99
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,730
for casual crawlers.

100
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,690
There's always a way.

101
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:51,260
I mean the page has to fill itself up somehow but some sites will just be a little too convoluted to

102
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,210
have it work.

103
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,180
So in this case it ended up working.

104
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:59,900
It's got some pretty nice requests responses that seem understandable enough that we could probably

105
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,940
figure it out so we can keep going.

106
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,790
That really gives it a lot of respect and appreciation for what search engines have to deal with.

107
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,400
AK particularly Google right to be able to catalog all the information out there on the web.

108
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,090
They need to be able to automate away that even as sites are changing their code can grab the information

109
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,410
so they're they're probably running servers so that it's just you know they could run that JavaScript

110
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:27,950
and get.

111
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,130
They probably rolling on to do all that.

112
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,720
Yeah they're probably running some into some full web browser interactively for all right good.

113
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,590
See you the next video.

114
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:38,970
Yeah.
