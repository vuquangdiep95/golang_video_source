1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,770
OK.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,050
Let's see main.

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,630
And where it all comes together and then also run it and see you see the results.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,540
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,680
So func main in a function like this where or in a program like this where you've got well-defined functions

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,520
with easy meanings main often becomes just hooking the multi yet.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,870
And so that's exactly what this mean is it.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,270
It calls get conversation to get all the convert to get the whole conversation.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:38,160
That's that second function that I've got after this I've got the slice of strings.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,230
First is the response I'm going to need to get all the tweets here.

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,820
So I create the tweets variable and then I arrange over all those h t strings in the for loop.

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:58,130
And each time through I call pass h t email to pull out all the tweets from that particular chunk of

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,230
HMO.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:08,540
And then after that I append all those tweets into the bigger tweets slice and I'm using the dot dot

15
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:15,590
dot very attic to expand out this slice of tweets into this append periodic function so that I can put

16
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,180
this slice into this slice

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,450
so once that S is for loops done I now have a complete slice of all the tweets in this tweets variable

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,720
and so in this case I'm just going to use Jason Marshall indent to put it into Jason format in it with

19
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:42,210
enough whitespace to be more readable and I print out printed all that Jason out and then I must get

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,600
a printout.

21
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,920
How many tweets I eventually came up so awesome.

22
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,860
So if I run this go run script go it's going to take a little bit because it's gotta wait a second between

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,910
each call Twitter so it takes longer than call which is only making one call overall then it's done.

24
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:08,080
I now have 60 tweets and if I look at here my bottom ones see ICD automation server they go back to

25
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
Twitter and scrolling all the way down past it.

26
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:22,350
They want to do that scrolling all the way down past all the infinite scrolls spacebar is a nice way

27
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,920
to do that you know that depends on the page.

28
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,530
I don't want her typing in inbox true.

29
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,760
So the very bottom would see ICD automation server.

30
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,560
So that's after all the scroll.

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,930
Oh that's awesome well done.

32
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,120
Let's jump back to the code for a second.

33
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,060
You anything more you want to say there is room for expansion on this.

34
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:52,430
If I look here some of these replies have replies to them themselves that are not actually being pulled

35
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,720
in.

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,160
Try to find one

37
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,540
like here you've got another comment here and it's got its own reply underneath it.

38
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:06,870
Yeah.

39
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,840
So that's not being pulled in but that's not being pulled in from here either.

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,820
So but getting into that would then require much more complicated code to then follow that pathway down

41
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,550
and it seems reasonable not just to get kind of what was showing up on this main list here.

42
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,200
So that's all I ended up making nice.

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,530
So just so I'm going to do my little talk through get conversation gives you that get conversation scroll

44
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,940
back up to that slice of string.

45
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,420
There we go.

46
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:46,190
And and the slice of string on get conversation is going to be all the tweets everything right.

47
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,640
Yeah well the L.A. Daily amount and then we range over all that.

48
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,550
There we go in passing the message and we get past that.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,440
We get that and we're going to pin that to our slice of tweet and and then we get all of our tweets

50
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,880
and then we're just going to put them to Jason and then we get a bite slice.

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,410
We turn that into a string so that we could print it nicely and then we see the length.

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,860
Yes.

53
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,960
That's all straight for awesome.

54
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,630
That's really well done.

55
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,680
It's fun to see.

56
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,010
And we got a little bit more for you in the next couple of videos.

57
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,980
Anything more to say about this.

58
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,770
For reals this time of year.

59
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,750
All right.

60
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,680
See the next video.
