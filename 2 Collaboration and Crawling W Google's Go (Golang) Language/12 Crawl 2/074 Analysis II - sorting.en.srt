1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,630
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,450
Now we're going to.

3
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:01,940
Sorry.

4
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:02,420
Yes.

5
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,740
Now we're going to sort the saga.

6
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,020
So we got word in fact we've got a slice of word infos.

7
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,690
Each one has a word and it count.

8
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,370
But now we want to sort it so it's in descending order.

9
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:20,710
We want the word info zero to be the most commonly appearing word in that way it's easily we can easily

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,930
look at it and read the values.

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,310
So sort of slice takes it a slice a slice as its first argument.

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:34,360
And the second argument it takes in is a function which obviously is an anonymous function to that function

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,820
it passes in to integers.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,210
I and j.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,200
It returns a boolean.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
This function is a less boolean.

17
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:54,460
What you're trying to do here is you will return true if with I index i is less than with index J and

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:04,250
so and then whatever's less will become will be earlier in the slice when it's sorted so because we

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,750
want earlier things in the slice to be things with bigger accounts.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,850
That means we want to say true if the count is higher

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,430
so.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:24,940
So in this case so much return with i dot count is greater than with J dot count because we want the

23
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:35,860
higher value to be less and so be closer to the beginning of the sordid slice slice after this point

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:44,160
we can return with and that is now a sorted slice of word infos tossing and I look forward to seeing

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,790
the results.

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,580
So this function is actually getting complicated.

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,320
So if I had some time I would probably split this up into a couple of smaller functions like one to

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:00,070
do the counting one convert into this into a sorted slice but for now this kind of work says it is say

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,450
so now we can actually call this is called Word Count it takes all the tweets

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,620
and it returns back the sword to candidates

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,420
and does not return an error of anything it will always work no error returns so don't bother checking

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,050
that.

33
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,500
Now we just need to print that.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:41,840
So I'm just going to range over assorted counts and just each time through I will print print f yeah

35
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:56,790
I was going to say the word colon the count New Line is the word and count it's now if I go back up

36
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,600
in run this

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,390
second Grace where I'm all saying

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:19,820
so lots of words that we should have once if you scroll way back to the top well a and to the four that's

39
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:28,370
to be expected nice there G.P.S. shrimp nine times here you see these big cloud cloud it's big project

40
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:38,910
you lots of you want to see you humanity's dog Daddy's big doctor like services graft graft well e-commerce

41
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,960
horrors rest yeah that's really interesting to look at.

42
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,010
Look at that.

43
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:51,890
See this is very basic just a word count is I mean there's lots of stuff there where you could merge

44
00:03:51,890 --> 00:04:01,430
some words together like I know I saw near the very bottom there was a there was a there is a G.P.S.

45
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,650
lifeform gators yep the European gateways that could probably be merged with your PCI for the purposes

46
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:15,930
of what project to make but so it's it's very general of a count but I mean that gives us a nice idea

47
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,630
of what to aim for for what to build next.

48
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,330
That's really cool.

49
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,150
Well done.

50
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,370
Anything else you want to add.

51
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,870
I would go back to this and like I said split this work thing into two functions.

52
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,650
If I want to be more properly proper coding Yeah I'm going to add that I think you're awesome.

53
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,350
And that was a real pleasure to watch you code that.

54
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,040
Very nice.

55
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,360
All right.

56
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,840
We'll see you in the next section.

57
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,420
Next video next section we'll figure out what that's going to be.

58
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,390
We'll see you there.
