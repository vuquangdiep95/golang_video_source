1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,570
All right.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,930
So now we're going to I'm going to kind of just make sure I understand this pass.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,480
SHE MOUTHS.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:16,280
So the first thing they're in line 78 you're passing in message it of its passing in is a variable that's

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,740
a type string.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,800
And that that variables and message.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,080
So show me just you to jump ahead and see.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,830
Pass each e-mails used in what's being passed in and so pass each e-mail is when you you have range

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,370
ranging over your responses and your responses come from get conversation.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,540
And so get conversation is that first to the second one is the second one that gets all the conversations

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:52,040
right and then the first one the first function we had was make conversation requests and the next ones

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,170
get all get conversations.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,440
All right.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,800
So get conversations returns that slice of string and then scroll down to the main and then get conversation.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,660
Gives us that response which is a slice of string and then we range over that slice of string.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,330
And for each wanting passing a message which is a string.

17
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,050
So that's just the way that each team now that was down there in depth tools that we saw.

18
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,240
All right good.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,850
And so then you take that each e-mail and you say we've got to turn this into a reader so you wrap strings

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:31,260
reader around it and use go query new document reader and again you've got all this sort of from the

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,620
example that turns it into a selection or whatever new document reader right then gives you access to

22
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,160
all those other methods.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,620
And so just go back to New document from reader for a second in the documentation and new document reader.

24
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,860
Right.

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:55,560
You got all those new document from reader gives you a document pointer to a document and the pointer

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,880
to a document in there.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,320
We have a pointer to a selection since we have a pointer to selection.

28
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,000
We have all of those methods.

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,900
And so now we have access to all those methods is that correct.

30
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,450
Yes.

31
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,180
So back to the code.

32
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,480
Yeah they're all the methods.

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:21,570
We have the doc and then we just check that error and your error is return nil fund error K and returning

34
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:29,610
an error if there's problems passing it up through chain of execution and then you slice tweets told

35
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,290
all your tweets and now you could just use those functions you got this kind of from the example you

36
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,020
looked at zero.

37
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,610
You got work and find and each you pass all that in and just return your slice of tweets when it's all

38
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,270
done.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,280
And that does that for each.

40
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,190
Each.

41
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,010
Each conversation basically right.

42
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,440
Yeah.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,140
The other slice of conversation.

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,150
So you're doing that with the range in Maine.

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,390
Yeah.

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,090
That's awesome.

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,830
Totally got it.

48
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,230
So this person just won.

49
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,980
One response gets passed with this.

50
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,280
And so then you have to put together all the slice of tweets back together at the end cool.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,750
And I was going to save this this question for you know and this reflection for kind of questions at

52
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:12,980
the end.

53
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:20,540
I think it's a good point to say this but like I I'm excited that I even understand the code and being

54
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,670
able to understand the code like like literally like little endorphins go off in my head when I understand

55
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:34,440
it's like a Las Vegas sort of you know no endorphin positive reinforcement kind of thing like goo I

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,680
got it I understood it right.

57
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,730
And I think that's also I get that when I actually write code you know and it works it's like oh I got

58
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,200
it it works like there's a little bit addictive quality that programming for me and I know it's like

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,150
that for other people it's like it's pleasing when you create a solution when you engineer something

60
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,580
that really works well it's pleasing when you can understand something that somebody else engineered

61
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,950
that works well.

62
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,960
And and so but that's I also just wanted to kind of point out that those are the steps in being able

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,830
to do.

64
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,750
First thing is to be able to understand right.

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,890
Like first you got to see it and then you got to be able to understand how it was done and then eventually

66
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,460
you're going to be able to do it.

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,880
So just take heart wherever you are on that process.

68
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,100
If you look at this and you're like well a little bit overwhelming or if you look at this and you're

69
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,380
like Okay I understand it don't think I could write it like that is the process that you go through

70
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,500
to eventually being able to write it.

71
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,490
You know you think of other fields other industries you know like whether it's you know soccer you know

72
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,470
and people saw you know Pele do certain things and then they went and they practice it and then they

73
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,240
were able to do it.

74
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,840
But at first they couldn't.

75
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,870
And you know or or music you know you hear somebody else play something and you're like wow.

76
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,430
Then you go practice it and eventually you can do that too.

77
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,720
But the first thing is being able to see somebody do it and understand that they're doing it.

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,440
And and then applying yourself to it being able to do it yourself eventually you can do it to but how

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,560
long did it take you to be able to write write code like this since you're 13.

80
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,780
That was their teammates.

81
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,530
Started coding.

82
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,300
So that's that's a long time.

83
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,030
And but so it takes some time and.

84
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,330
But it's 13 years ago actually.

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,410
So my life.

86
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,080
Yeah.

87
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,890
But it comes if you apply yourself.

88
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:22,190
All right.

89
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,050
That's the low reflection when you have anything where you want to add.

90
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,640
Not about this but dreading I'm just jumping to Maine.

91
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,360
Yeah.

92
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,040
All right.

93
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,160
Let's do that.

94
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,970
See you at Expedia.
