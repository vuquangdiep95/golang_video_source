1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,760
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,650
Sweet.

3
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,960
How do you.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,600
We had this nice introduction I just wrote this little summary.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,200
The spectrum of ethics maturation and spirituality from self-absorption to selflessness.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,650
Now we're gonna talk about what it takes to be successful as a student.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,920
And this is really important to know because you know it can feel overwhelming like there's this huge

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,540
mountain in front of you that you've got to climb and it can feel like I don't know if I could ever

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:27,940
get there.

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,480
I remember when I was young four years of high school seemed so long.

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,150
Four years of undergraduate and seemed so long.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,810
Right.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,850
And then owe me two more years in graduate school.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,950
I don't know if I could do that.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:48,310
I'm done with school so long it just seems too long now as I creep up on 50 you know it's like 10 years

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,230
to get a doctorate.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,880
Nope no problem right.

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,330
Put me in solitary confinement.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,400
Give me some books I'll see and give me a computer I'll see in ten years you know like I could do that

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,050
I could do it you know.

21
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:06,070
And and so it doesn't seem as as big as you get older but when you're young that mountain can seem big

22
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,840
such a big mountain to climb so much to learn.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,590
And so how do you climb that mountain.

24
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,490
By the way I used to have teachers and you know this if you'd been in my other classes I've had teachers

25
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:22,280
like one teacher used to say drop by drop the bucket gets filled drop by drop the bucket gets filled.

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,990
And so every day this is how you succeed as a student.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,760
You need to have grit and you need to have persistence.

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,730
And every day you just add a drop to the bucket.

29
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,210
So drop by dropped out buckets and get filled.

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,650
And after three days there's not going to be much in the bucket.

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,310
You've only added three drops.

32
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,810
And after three months you'll look in the bucket and you'll see man there's not much in there I've been

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,780
at this three months and I'm not that good.

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,220
I'm learning the guitar right now.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,190
Maybe at some point I'll play some for you and it's slow going right.

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,270
But drop by drop.

37
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,410
I'm getting better.

38
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,630
And after three years you look in that bucket you guess what you're going to be like Wow.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,620
There's there's some water in that bucket I filled that bucket some I've gotten some skills and so it

40
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,330
takes time.

41
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,950
But the way you get there is just drop by drop drop I drop you add you drop by drop the bucket gets

42
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:15,920
filled you fill the bucket drop by drop you fill the bucket and also had a teacher who would say persistently

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:27,010
patiently you are bound to succeed persistently patiently you are bound to succeed.

44
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,120
And so if you just keep with it and this is the research of Angela Duckworth and this is what makes

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,880
a student successful and what makes a student successful doesn't matter where you're born It doesn't

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,840
matter whether your parents were or we're not educated doesn't matter if you come from the good side

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,860
or the bad side of the tracks what makes a student successful is grit it's grit it's just sticking with

48
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:57,320
its purse persistence perseverance it's not giving up it's dedication and devotion to what are you going

49
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,490
to devote your life right.

50
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,360
You devote your life to something if you chew if you don't answer that question you are answering that

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,840
question.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,430
It's much better to choose something to devote your life to what are you devoting your life to.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,830
Right.

54
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,060
So when you devote your life you say I'm going to do this and then you do it every day and you add those

55
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,240
drops persistently patiently with perseverance and persistence.

56
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:21,680
Right.

57
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,210
You add those drops you keep going you get better and you get better and you get better and that's how

58
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,320
you succeed as a student.

59
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
You just have grit.

60
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,840
You don't quit.

61
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,860
You just keep going.

62
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:36,110
You don't give up and over time you're gonna get better and at times it can feel overwhelming at times

63
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,900
it could seem confusing but you keep working with the material.

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,910
I keep playing the guitar right.

65
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,700
And over time you start getting better.

66
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,940
You start getting better.

67
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,220
So that is research backed.

68
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,560
It takes grit to succeed as a student.

69
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,440
That's what makes students successful is whether or not they have that grit.

70
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,780
You just keep going.

71
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,160
So that's good to know.

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,110
Since you're a student you need to understand what makes students successful and it seems like there's

73
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,210
one more thing that I want to share about that.

74
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,170
So this is it.

75
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,240
I want to share an anecdote.

76
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,340
So one point in my life I was very interested in learning what enlightenment was.

77
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,410
And I'd read a lot about it and I realized that to get there from everything I read you know you needed

78
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,730
to meditate.

79
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,260
And so I decided that I was going to I was a bachelor I was gonna make this the number one priority

80
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,710
in my life.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,020
And so every day I decided I was going to meditate one hour and then I also decided that if I missed

82
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,630
it one day I was going to make it up the next.

83
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,720
So if I missed meditating one hour one day on the next day I would meditate two hours and I did that

84
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:49,350
for seven years every day sitting for an hour with my eyes shut.

85
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,940
This is also that really destroyed period of my life whereas about as low as I think I could have gotten

86
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,120
without dying literally people were saying to me at that point in my life do you have cancer.

87
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,920
And so every day I meditated for an hour and I did that for seven years and is my number one priority

88
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,600
and come hell or high water if nothing else happened on that day I meditated.

89
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,800
And if somebody called me up at 7 o'clock and I had to meditate yet and they said hey I want to go to

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,280
the movies I would be like why I gotta meditate.

91
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,490
How about tomorrow.

92
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,490
Right.

93
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:27,260
And so I was just fiercely committed to every day adding that drop and that type of focus that type

94
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,870
of commitment if you have that focus if you have that commitment you could get through all kinds of

95
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,140
obstacles.

96
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,770
So if you make it your number one priority and then every day I'm going to do it I'm going to do it.

97
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm going to do it.

98
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,060
You add those drops persistently patiently.

99
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,690
You are going to succeed.

100
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,340
You're going to succeed.

101
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,330
So Bill Gates and Warren Buffett were asked What is it.

102
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,250
In one word more than anything else independently they were asked this by Bill Gates his father and

103
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,250
both Bill and Warren responded.

104
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,360
The one word that's contributed the most to their individual success is they both chose the word focus.

105
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,140
Being able to focus on something.

106
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,900
So that's that's what it takes to be successful as a student.

107
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,630
I think it's important for you to know that as a student that you just have to keep doing it every day.

108
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,480
Right.

109
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,830
You do it every day and 10 minutes a day an hour a day is better than 70 minutes a week or seven hours.

110
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,970
You know on one day.

111
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,190
So a little bit every day is better than a lot.

112
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,720
Every now and then a little bit every day is better than a lot.

113
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,620
Every now and then.

114
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,320
So that's how you succeed as a student is just checking my clock.

115
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,130
Make sure this camera's not going to stop.

116
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,640
And I've put some resources here.

117
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:45,490
This is a little little picture I put together of Seven Habits of Highly Successful People.

118
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:51,060
And so this is a book by Stephen Covey and I just kind of paraphrase a lot of this stuff in my own words.

119
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,070
This is what Stephen Covey says it takes to be successful.

120
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,650
And then here's a link to the journey class so you can look on this platform from my course on leading

121
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,120
a successful life.

122
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,340
And it's called The Journey.

123
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:07,020
So if you're interested in more life skills to succeed in life just search on this platform wherever

124
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,170
you're watching this course for the course the journey or search the journey.

125
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,380
Todd MacLeod.

126
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,920
And that will bring up that course so you can enroll in that course to learn more skills to be successful

127
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,660
in life.

128
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,160
Because I've had to learn those skills and in a lot of people don't have them and the more you know

129
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,230
them the better you're going to be able to do.

130
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:25,530
All right.

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,440
So number one takeaway from this video is that to succeed as a student you just need to do it every

132
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,810
day and not give up.

133
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,830
You've got to have grit.

134
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,760
And if you do that you're going to get better and you're going to succeed.

135
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,150
That's what it takes to succeed as a student.
