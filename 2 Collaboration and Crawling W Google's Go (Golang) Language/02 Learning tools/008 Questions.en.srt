1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,810
So now we're going to see how to ask questions in this course.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,100
And there's two resources I want to give you for asking questions and so the first resource resource

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,430
is the go Ling bridge forum.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:16,410
And so the going bridge forum is a form of people who like to go programming language.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
And this is the best place to ask questions.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,250
So come in here and ask your question.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:33,720
And there's many highly experienced top of the field go programmers who hang out in this area and and

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,740
it's a great place to ask questions.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,280
So I'm going to add here.

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:38,860
Right.

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:49,440
Best great place to ask questions place to ask questions is the going bridge forum and we'll just put

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,340
that as a bullet point and drop in your.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
So that's my number one recommendation for asking questions.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,530
And then if you need to reach me so try to get your question answered first on the going bridge forum

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,900
or somewhere else and if the question isn't answered then you can reach out to me.

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:13,500
But these courses I've taught like literally two hundred thousand people on one platform and ninety

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,980
thousand people are you know like over two point six five.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:23,790
Last time I added it all up million people have taken my courses and so when there's that many people

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,350
it's really hard for me to answer you know 100 questions.

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,360
That takes me all day I can't do it.

21
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,870
There's just not enough time in the day and I'm also you know tenured professor and I'm also a father

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,930
so unfortunately I wish I could sit down with each of you and answer each of your questions but unfortunately

23
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,580
I just find myself running out of time and then I feel bad that there's all these unanswered questions

24
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,320
and that's not my wish.

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,450
It's just the reality of the situation of teaching at scale like this.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,770
And so really try to get your question answered in the Goodling bridge forum and then if that doesn't

27
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,810
work you could always hit me up on Twitter and there's a lot of people who follow me on Twitter.

28
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,810
So if you ask the question on Twitter and just go to this link right here if you ask the question and

29
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,170
tag me in it so you might say like I'm going to tweet and you might say hey at Todd.

30
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,160
So I'm tagged in it and that way it comes to my attention.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,180
What is this.

32
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,540
And then you add a link to code or your question or whatever.

33
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,660
So I might not be able to answer the answer the question but a lot of people who follow me and like

34
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,850
right now have a ninety five hundred followers lot of people who follow me or go programmers or into

35
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,820
programming so you will often have other people answer the question other people chime in.

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,440
So those are the two best ways to ask questions is just first on the form going bridge and then also

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,850
just right there on Twitter.

38
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,990
And and please know that if I'm not able to respond it's not personal.

39
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:03,010
I totally wish I could respond to every one of the thousands and thousands of questions that I get and

40
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,110
I totally wish and want to be able to sit down and have a meal with you.

41
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,690
So maybe at some point in the future if I ever end up in your city we could do that or a bunch of us

42
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,310
could go out and get some dinner.

43
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,050
I've done that before I was up in Portland and a bunch of former students and I from these online courses

44
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,490
got together and is awesome.

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,250
So definitely reach out and say hi to me on Twitter.

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,350
I love hearing from people all hard.

47
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,270
I'll give you a quick reply.

48
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,320
I love connecting.

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,640
You know when people reach out to me often I'll follow them and be like oh yeah this is somebody that

50
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,110
if I'm ever in their town and then I'll tweet like Hey I'm coming to New York.

51
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,260
Anybody want to get together and grab a bite to eat more go out.

52
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:41,900
It's fun.

53
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,980
So connect with me on Twitter.

54
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,950
But when you have questions try that going bridge forum if that doesn't work tweet to me and tag me

55
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,560
in it and off and other people who follow me will answer it.

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,790
And if I can't I will try to answer them too.

57
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,630
Wish that wasn't the reality I wish I could be there for everybody.

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,790
But that's also not the way the world works.

59
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,270
It's not that's not reality.

60
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,830
So yes that's how you ask questions and hopefully at some point in the future we can grab a bite to

61
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,510
eat somewhere with some other students in whatever city you live in so definitely connect with me on

62
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,190
Twitter.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,590
All right.

64
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,600
Next video we're going to talk about principles.
