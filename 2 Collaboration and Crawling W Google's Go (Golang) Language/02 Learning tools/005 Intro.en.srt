1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,120
All right so so far in this class we've done a welcome video where I commended you for embarking upon

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,280
the noblest of all endeavors you learned about my credentials I gave you course resources and then you

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,080
learned that there's going to be two teachers in this class and that I'm going to be learning alongside

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,850
with you and making sure that it's all taught well.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,240
So it's clear to all of us which is is built for humans and we also had a big piece of you know including

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,460
humanity in everything you do.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,120
And I'll just add an anecdote to that and the anecdote is the Harvard Adult Development study so you

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,910
could YouTube it.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,140
It's a TED talk.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,550
And so you know Ted Harvard Adult Development study and I spelled adult with an E.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,090
Google probably fix it for me.

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,090
Thank you.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,120
And so here it is.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,850
It's a great TED talk and.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,700
And that really emphasizes the importance of humanity and human relationships it's actually the number

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:02,210
one factor that correlates with longevity and fulfillment and meaning is having strong human relationships.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,900
So we emphasize a lot of humanity.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,540
Now we're going to drop into this new section learning tools and we're going to take a look at what

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,790
it takes to be successful as a student.

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,980
So we'll do that the next video I'll make this the introduction video and then we're gonna see how you

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,630
could change the speed on videos.

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,150
That's what the acceleration is going to be about.

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,620
You can speed him up slowing down.

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,760
Show you that if you don't know it probably a lot of you do but just in case there's somebody out there

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,340
that doesn't get students who say to me you know you talk too fast and I get other students say to me

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,440
You talk too slow for the same video.

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,050
So I'm gonna show you how to get the speed just the way you like it then well I'll show share with you

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,900
how to ask questions the best way to ask questions and where to go you know for a community of people

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,160
to answer questions.

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,260
We'll talk about some principles.

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,270
I'm not quite sure what that video is gonna be about.

32
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,860
I wrote it but right now I'm spacing on it and collaboration and exercises and anecdotes.

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm going to share all that in here.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,220
This will give you a basis for what it takes to be a good student.

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,850
How this class is going to be run I know is quite a bit of introductory material.

36
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,650
Feel free to skip it if you're not into it.

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,240
Maybe you're enjoying it and finding an interesting.

38
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:17,520
I think there's value not only in getting down to the nuts and bolts the brass tacks but also in thinking

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,070
about all of this material just from a philosophical humanitarian perspective.

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,180
I think that that adds value and will be a benefit to you.

41
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,570
This is stuff I've reflected upon for my entire life.

42
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:38,730
My father was a professor of sociology and I was steeped in this material and all kinds of interesting

43
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,630
theories grew up around the university.

44
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,700
And so you know I've got a lot of interesting perspectives.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,970
You know I'd love to share with you about the continuum of ethics spirituality and maturation which

46
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,080
to me are the same thing that would be a cool thing to talk with you about at some point because nobody

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,450
else sees it the way or articulates it the way that I see it.

48
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,700
And I think it's you know much more intuitive and palatable than than Colbert's Theory of Moral Development

49
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,160
anyhow.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,670
So that's that's where we're gonna be learn in this section.

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,440
And right now I guess I'll just share that piece since I did it.

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,740
So if you think about the maturation or if you think about spirituality or if you think about ethics.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,400
Right.

54
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,320
A great framework for thinking about ethics is that it's a continuum.

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,720
And at one end of the continuum you have self-absorption you're only thinking of yourself you're completely

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,550
egocentric you are an anti anti-social right.

57
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,000
They call this actually anti-social personality disorder.

58
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,450
You only think about yourself you'll kill someone for your for their watch.

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,790
Yeah I like that watch you'll kill him take it and wanting you think twice about it.

60
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,180
You don't think of others right.

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,870
That's one end of the spectrum.

62
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,030
The other end of the spectrum is you think so much of others who don't even think of yourself.

63
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,260
So Gandhi it's OK if I die.

64
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,150
Martin Luther King it's OK if I die just so long as everybody else.

65
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,000
It helps everybody else right.

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
Buddha Jesus right.

67
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,610
Like spiritual figure is often way out here not thinking of the self thinking of others.

68
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,660
And often many spiritual pasts are about releasing the self so southern Pentecostal background.

69
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,940
My father my grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher you know in Christianity they say releasing my will

70
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,260
for Thy Will right and giving up the self giving up my will for thy will.

71
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:35,250
And so this is the path this continuum the spectrum from self-absorption to selflessness.

72
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,570
And it's the path of ethics and so the more that we make pro social behaviors the more we're thinking

73
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:48,930
of others the more we come out this way the more ethical we are not aligns with all of the ethical research

74
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:55,440
and theory and also actually aligns to the Harvard Adult Development study which says that when you

75
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,630
do things for other years others you're aligning with your nature and that makes you feel good that

76
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,260
makes you gives your life meaning and fulfillment that helps you live longer.

77
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,950
Like literally helps you live longer be healthier.

78
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,250
Right.

79
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,900
Taking pro social behaviors not just leaving trash but picking up trash even if it's not yours and throwing

80
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,170
it away not just leaving your shopping cart in the middle of the parking lot.

81
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,160
Hey somebody else can do it.

82
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,110
I'm giving people a job right.

83
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,240
Somebody else can deal with it right.

84
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:25,490
But pushing your car away like contributing to the social tribal community to which we all belong as

85
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,410
humans we're social animals.

86
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,940
So when you align with that social nature when you do pro social behavior you're aligning with your

87
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,440
nature when you line the nature.

88
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,930
Nature makes you feel good because nature wants you to do it.

89
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,310
Eating feels good.

90
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,640
Sleeping feels good right.

91
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,460
Reproducing feels good because nature wants you to do it.

92
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,300
Being social pro social when you're like that nature makes you feel good.

93
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,990
So that's the continuum of ethics right from self-absorption anti-social personality disorder to selflessness

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,270
taking pro social behavior.

95
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,380
That's ethics.

96
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:04,390
That's also maturation when you're born you're you know others have to take care of you.

97
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,660
You know you're not thinking of others so much but as you've grown mature you actually later in life

98
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,360
with the general timidity phase where you know you're just thinking of others because you realize oh

99
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,860
I'm not going to be here forever and I'll leave this nice for the next generation.

100
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:25,130
How can I help out others and leave this world as a kind good person who was beneficial to the pro social

101
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,170
the tribe.

102
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,640
And so that's that's the path of ethics.

103
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,610
That's the ethics that's math maturation it's also spirituality.

104
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:44,530
Any spiritual system worth its salt is going to teach you to focus more less on the self including psychology.

105
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:44,780
Right.

106
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,160
And that you'll be happier for it.

107
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,680
So that's a little bit about that.

108
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,570
That's an introduction to the section.

109
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,290
Learning tools in the next video we're gonna see what it takes to be successful as a student.
