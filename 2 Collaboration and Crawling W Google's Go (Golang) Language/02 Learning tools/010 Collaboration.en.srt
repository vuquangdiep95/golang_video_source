1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,060
So just a real quick note on collaboration here.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,460
And so we create these courses and in this course it's going to be we are creating this course about

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,730
Daniel myself but we create these courses and then we move on.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,030
Right.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,560
Like I'm off doing something else learning something new.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,790
Creating a new course.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,200
And so the courses are really a collaborative process.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:29,820
And I just wanted to invite that collaboration from you and let you know that we not only welcome it

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,350
but that we want it.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,000
And so that collaborative collaborative process includes you letting us know if there's a video that

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,990
needs to be updated.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,850
Just give us a heads up or also if there's something in the code that you think should be changed you

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,150
could submit a pull request to us and we'll take a look at that and hopefully get to that.

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,320
And if you wanted to be like even an administrator on one of the get hub accounts where you could accept

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,170
and reject pull requests you know our repos are backed up obviously.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,000
So you know you could reach out to us and say Hey I'd love to be able to help facilitate this.

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,610
And you watch that that repo for the watch the repo for this course as Paul requests come in.

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,240
I could look at them and contribute to the community and also you know continue learning and see what

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,360
other people are thinking.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,800
And so we welcome that collaborative process and that collaborative process can include let us know

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:30,030
when video needs to be updated and then also

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:47,330
offer code suggestions pull requests through get hub and moderate manage admin whatever they call it

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,800
right get have to accept reject pull requests.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,860
So if you wanted to fill that role just reach out to me let me know and we get Addy in there to pull

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,050
into the code base.

27
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,300
All right.

28
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,560
So that's a collaborative process.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,280
We not only welcome it but we want want that so that this course stays robust and good for everybody.

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,320
So please let us know if you want to help out any ways or just help out in those ways.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,790
If you're interested in doing that.
