1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,670
So now I already spoke to this.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,480
But you're going to see how you can speed up or slow down these videos so if I'm talking too fast for

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,900
you you could slow this video down.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,270
And if I'm talking too slow for you you could speed this video up.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:19,770
I will often watch videos on to X and then you know if it's something that I need to slow down then

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,640
I slow it down.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,770
After a while you're I'm a really good listener.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,770
I'm not such a good reader but after a while you know.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,970
Yeah right.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,640
After a while your brain starts to figure out how to listen quickly so that works for me.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,910
So I'm just going to open up this video here.

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,060
She opened this one because this is like the trailer for the journey and you could see it there and

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,860
if I wanted to I'm going to like my own video.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,920
How do you like that.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,310
And if I want to speed this video up I would just come here and I would click that and then I would

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:57,250
go to playback speed and I could go hey plays twice as fast or hey slow this down.

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,210
So that's how you speed up or slow down these videos which can be useful to you if you didn't already

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,830
didn't already know that that can be totally useful to be able to do that and you can go check out this

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,780
course healthier wealthier happier.

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,170
Right.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,310
Who wouldn't want that.

22
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:11,640
All right.

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,540
See the next video.
