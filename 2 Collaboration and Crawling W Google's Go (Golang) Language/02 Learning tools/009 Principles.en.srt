1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,530
OK.

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,120
So I want to just speak to principles here for a moment and what principles represent me as I'm going

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,930
to teach you.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,490
Let me see.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,590
I'm going to teach you the principle.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,020
Looking for the phrasing I used and it's right here there is the principle and I'm going to just uppercase

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,780
that because it didn't just pop out to me.

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,470
I'm gonna do.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,930
There's the principle and there's the practice right.

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,320
And so we're gonna teach you the principle.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,560
And Dan you'll be here when I finish recording the centrist stuff we're gonna teach you the principle

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,170
and we're gonna show you the current practice.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,720
And so just an illustration of that.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:36,960
Right.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,090
Like Twitter recently changed and the.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,910
And this is just to illustrate the principle is that you can tweet and the current practice is that

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,620
you come down here and you click tweet right.

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,850
But you know the practice by the time you watch this video might be that the tweet buttons up here or

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,440
the tweet buttons over there.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,050
So we've taught you the principle here is the principle that you know that being able to tweet is possible

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,000
and then we'll show you the current practice like this is how you do it right now.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,040
But things might change from the time you watch this video to from the time we record this video to

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,280
the time you watch this video the practice the implementation might change.

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,310
And so if it has changed you know the principal go and see if you could try to figure out what is the

25
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,260
current practice.

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,590
And so you could google it you could YouTube it.

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,880
Right.

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,660
Like how do you do it.

29
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,390
Now you could try to just figure it out on your own but if you can't figure out the current practice

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,900
you know on going bridge form or as tweeting and tagging me with a question if it's not easy to figure

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,360
out definitely give me a heads up that like hey this video is looking a little bit it isn't clear to

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,130
students anymore it's not applicable to students anymore.

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,750
You might consider go update it tell me to go update it go update it dog.

34
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,920
Just tell me to go update so.

35
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,990
So that's the principal the practice will teach to the principal.

36
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,290
We'll show you the current practice by the time you watch this video which will be later than the time

37
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,450
at which it is recorded.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,660
The practice might be different.

39
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,620
Try to figure out the new practice if you can because you know the principal.

40
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,660
This is something that's possible.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,160
Try to figure out how you do it now.

42
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,890
And if you can't figure it out by googling it you doing it or you know asking questions let me know

43
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,420
that there's a video that needs to be updated.

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,390
So that's what principals is all about right.

45
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,470
We'll teach you the principals and then the practice might shift a little bit but see if you can figure

46
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,730
it out.

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,590
If you can't let us know and we'll update the video.
