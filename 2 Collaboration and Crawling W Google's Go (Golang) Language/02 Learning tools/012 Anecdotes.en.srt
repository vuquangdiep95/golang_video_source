1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,530
All right.

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,000
So we are at the last video in this kind of getting started section and just learning about the course

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,520
and the last thing I want to share is just about personal anecdotes.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,890
And we already spoke about how students statistically research backed will do much better in classes

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,680
where they like the teacher versus classes where they don't like the teacher like Noda who needed to

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,640
research that.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,080
But it's actually been researched and and so as part of that I will include personal anecdotes at times.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,870
I've already done that some of this course.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,930
And as an illustration of the collaborative process I'm always welcoming feedback to the classes and

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:48,360
I'm just going to add that in here providing providing feedback providing proof putting feedback on

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,390
how to improve the course.

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,160
One piece of feedback that a student gave to me one time was like hey todd love your courses but I'm

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,470
in a rush dude like I don't have time to hear about your friend Joe and what happened to him when he

14
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,350
was driving to work.

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,190
Like can you like just like teach me the coding stuff.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,960
And I realized OK when I include personal anecdotes which which have a pedagogical value right they

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,780
have a reason for being in there because it allows us to connect as humans and allows you to get to

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:27,000
know me hopefully you like me if you don't that's OK I'm not for everybody but you know if you develop

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,570
that connection with the teacher if you get not only skills knowledge but also wisdom motivation inspiration

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,130
like all the data says that's going to be better for you in your life.

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,230
And so I'm here looking out for you.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,530
I want this to be the best course possible this is what the research says will make it the best class.

23
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,130
So but personal anecdotes when I include them I will include them at the end of the video.

24
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,810
So if you are in a rush right.

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,640
If you're in a rush.

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,360
Generally speaking as much as possible try to include them at the end video and if you're in a rush

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,730
you could just like watch like I'm here I got learn to code.

28
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,680
OK I get to work.

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,610
You just watch the coding stuff and then occasionally at the end of video be like oh I got to tell you

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,840
about this.

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,090
I'll tell you that in the video.

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,450
And then at the end of the video all I'll tell you some personal anecdotes I will save my personal anecdotes

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,470
to the end of the video.

34
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,560
If and when we have any of those to share.

35
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,770
So that's that's that's anecdotes.

36
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,210
The reason we include them is research back plus I just like chat and at times and sharing what's going

37
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,850
on in my life.

38
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,730
And so that's that's what the anecdotes are all about.

39
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,550
And I will save them for the end of the video as much as possible.

40
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,650
So if you're in a rush you could just get through the cone stuff in the beginning.

41
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:45,570
All right ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of this foundation of the class is 4 7 ten eleven

42
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,360
videos I hope it was worth your time.

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,950
Hope you're getting value out of this and I look forward to jumping into the course which we're going

44
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,750
to do starting in the next section.

45
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,540
It's gonna be awesome.

46
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,680
Daniel's going to be here with me and we're gonna have some fun coding and learning some skills so I'm

47
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,850
glad you're here.

48
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,230
If you watch all that interest stuff.

49
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,410
Hope you enjoyed it.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,710
And yeah let's get started.

51
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,840
Let's get started could see in the next video.
