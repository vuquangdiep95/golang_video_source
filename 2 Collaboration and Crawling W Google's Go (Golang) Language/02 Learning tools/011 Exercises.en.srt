1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,800
So we're going to include exercises in this course hands on exercises really make a big difference in

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,610
learning material.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:12,630
I've seen that over twenty three years being a college professor a university professor and so it's

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,550
really easy and tempting just to watch these videos and keep gone.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,810
It's late at night and it's just kind of fun right.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,990
But it's also really important to apply what you're learning.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,770
That's going to deepen your learning it's going to quicken your learning it's going to allow you to

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,690
learn more efficiently and effectively so you'll learn quicker more efficiently and more effectively.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,490
You're going to retain it for longer you're going to know it better so more efficiently more effectively

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,530
you will learn as Yoda said.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,520
If you do the exercises right.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,260
So the exercises are included for your benefit.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,310
Feel free to do them.

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,230
This is obviously your course this is obviously your life.

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,250
You are in charge of your life.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,830
You get to choose what you do.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,190
You can go through this entire thing sequentially or you could pick and choose and jump over whatever

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,790
you want.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,370
You do not need to do the exercises we are not assigning grade maybe this course is being used at a

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,600
college or university or some other class where that teacher will assign a grade.

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,020
But in this class as you and I write here you don't need to turn your homework into us.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:10,920
Right.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,540
The homework is there for your benefit.

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,450
So we'll have homework or we'll have we'll have exercises hands on exercises there for your benefit.

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,900
And we'll also include the solutions to those and we do that.

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,670
So it's a more robust course because we want to help you learn.

27
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,730
So if they're beneficial do you do them.

28
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,830
And if you don't feel like you need them feel free to step over them.

29
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,010
Either way works.

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,020
But that's what the exercises are all about.

31
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,330
Exercises are not required.

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:36,710
OK.

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,220
So that's that's exercises.
