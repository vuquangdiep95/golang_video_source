1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,070
All right so we're done with the hands on exercises now we're moving into G.P.S. and the first thing

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,280
we're gonna do is learn a little bit about P C and Daniel's been doing some research on this I'm going

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,500
to be learning about it right alongside with you.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,830
What did you find out about JROTC here.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:26,970
DANIEL So GOPAC ended up being kind of almost a replacement for communication protocol that Google developed

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:37,840
and a G or P C is actually a recursive name GOP C stands for GOPAC wrote procedure call it yeah it's

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,910
the annual hey is our piece GOPAC Stanford Google GAAP seems like I don't know.

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,590
And then under that fake you you found GAAP C stands for a GAAP so.

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,210
OK.

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,570
GAAP C kind of like you know what Jason stands for G javascript object notation but here GAAP stands

11
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,880
for GOPAC remote procedure call of course.

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,980
That's fine.

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,210
So yeah.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,970
So GAAP C was developed at Google and and there's a couple of things to it but one of the things is

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,050
it's an alternative to Jason and starting to become used more more widely.

16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,280
Right.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,600
Yeah it's it's it's become something that's used.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,040
Yes.

19
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:24,390
So it's it's an alternative to HBP and GOPAC most often like ninety nine point ninety nine percent of

20
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,270
the time it uses Protocol Buffers first communicate for how you pass data around.

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:40,440
So this is similar to ATP you're using Jason so GOP sees Protocol Buffers so GOP sees CBC or B.C. to

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:49,230
call methods on your server or remote as opposed to ACP you're sending in requests with a method and

23
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:57,690
a path and then instead of a body to an HP request in GOPAC you've got protocol but for message.

24
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,130
OK.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,060
So old way HDP make a request an endpoint and then I get a response back some Jason.

26
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,610
Right.

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:17,310
That's one you knew a G.P.S. and make a request to get back a prototype off and the prototype is binary

28
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,200
information but it's data right.

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,530
Yes yes it's a replacement for Jason it's smaller and more efficient to encode and decode into it.

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,120
All right.

31
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,120
So so that's what GOPAC is.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,400
It's a little hard to use the HP Jason HP libraries are everywhere because it's used so often.

33
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,930
So it's in the standard library for most period languages.

34
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,040
And same thing for Jason.

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,690
It's so common that it's insanely everything GOPAC.

36
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,930
Not so much.

37
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,890
So the GOP see part of it the the transport is simple enough.

38
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,020
That's just a library for every language but in the protocol buffer is actually where it gets a little

39
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,510
more complicated to use G.P.S..

40
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:06,840
And so in so in the next video we'll get how to install G.P.S. and the protocol buffer compiler Yeah.

41
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:13,190
And so the best way to understand something is often just to see it in action and says we work through

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,040
kind of seeing in an actual game and greater understanding what you see as the good starting point of

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,120
understanding G.P.S. is it's HBP Jason GOPAC protocol.

44
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,370
It's a new way that we could exchange information between machines.

45
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,500
All right sounds good.
