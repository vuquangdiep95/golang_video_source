1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,920
Okay so now when Daniel was doing all of that I noticed I started to glaze over.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,340
And that's why at the end of that video I was like wait I got to go through that again with you and

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,350
I wanted to get some notes and so I put together some notes here and then we're gonna get my system

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,860
set up just so you could see that installation and so will I will call this installation.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,670
Just keep Mac and so you saw a window on the last one.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,390
And now you're going to see it on the windows.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,410
It's called Windows and you're going to see it on Mac.

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,150
And so the steps there if you take a look at those steps the first step was to go to the Web site and

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,750
then go to a quick start go and and then install the pro CE program and the Potosi compiler is used

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,320
to generate the G.P.S. service code and then we take the executable from Proto.

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:57,660
So I did all of that open it up came down zip file and I got this here and then inside this bin folder

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,640
we got proto see into this proto C has to be found by my computer when my computer looks for executable

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:14,790
and the environment variable upon which to which my computer looks for executable is the path environment

14
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,890
variable and so I just want to make sure that this proto C is discoverable somewhere on my path.

15
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:28,650
And so if I go to my terminal and I echo dolor path it will show me my path very long so I can look

16
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,330
through here at all the places set and I could put it in some location and add that location here if

17
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:39,780
I wanted to my path variable or I could just use a location that is already existing and so I think

18
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,780
I'll take my privacy and put it in user local bands I'm just going to copy that and and then I need

19
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,280
to move it from this location to there.

20
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:57,030
And so right now I am actually in No not that location singing chat change documents change direct directory

21
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:06,510
to documents and then inside documents it is proto C and and then inside proto C it has been and then

22
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:13,050
now inside of there I'm going to move that and I'm going to move proto C and I'm going to move it to

23
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,980
this location.

24
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,120
Is that all look right to you.

25
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,710
Yes.

26
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,290
And I'm gonna hit enter and if I see to that location and then doing allows I could see I've got proto

27
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,460
C in there.

28
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,030
So that's good.

29
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,600
And that was the next step on the processes to take the executable from proto C stored in some location

30
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,330
at that location on your path environment variable.

31
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,000
And that was all that.

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,870
After that we need to import this this package right here.

33
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:48,840
Get icon going above proto see Django and using go modules create a file like this in your project and

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,460
Daniel's already created that file.

35
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,280
But before I pull that code down I'm going to go here and take a look some below.

36
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,990
And beneath that I don't have that in here yet.

37
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,570
There's nothing in there about GitHub dot.com going proto above GitHub dot com going above.

38
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,350
I don't have anything in there.

39
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,260
I don't have that in there yet.

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,800
So next thing I'm in do is just on my terminal and get myself current with Daniel.

41
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,430
So I need to see these back to documents and then inside see documents go into the go project and do

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,080
get status and and I'm your branch is behind or G.M. by one committee can be fast forwarded get pulled

43
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,580
update.

44
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:41,020
So do I get full and then do I get status again and get add Dash 8 add my homework and get commit dash

45
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,030
and and I'm gonna change it this time I'm doing great.

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,210
Often I tell students You're doing great as encouragement I'm giving myself a little encouragement after

47
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:59,850
my homework and then I'm gonna push that up and and so that should all be good.

48
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:07,470
Now get status and and now when I take a look here I should have Daniel's code down here and then there's

49
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:13,520
five GOPAC and in G.P.S. we have tools and then we have this right there.

50
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:22,980
And now if I look at my go mod that is still not shown going proto but for it there genius I love it.

51
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,370
And so now that we have that file right here.

52
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:33,690
So it's bringing that n confirm this is in go mod and now I want to run go and stall is that's correct

53
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,570
at this step.

54
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,360
So go install is the next step.

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,660
And this is going to actually bring the code down so that it's on my computer right now it just says

56
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,950
go get it if it's used or we're not using it anywhere so it hasn't gone and gotten that right.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,620
Yes.

58
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,080
So but first thing takes you go being set.

59
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,180
Oh that has to be done first.

60
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,500
All right.

61
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,080
So I want to set my my go been to environment variable to something and go Benz one word.

62
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,460
Right.

63
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,060
Yes two.

64
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,990
There you go.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,090
So we'll go take a look at.

66
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,350
Back to my nano.

67
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:17,380
Well we could do first of all go in B and so might go Ben is currently not set to anything and now I'm

68
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,210
going to nano dot bash.

69
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,670
And by the way I'm in kind of my user folder and then inside there on a Mac.

70
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:32,770
I've got my bash profile and that's where I set environment variables and so I'm going to now nano my

71
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:42,420
dot bash profile and and then and here I can just copy this basically export go.

72
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,580
Ben is equal to forward slash users.

73
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:54,870
And we had a little discussion about where should I set my Go Ben to with go modules and just to kind

74
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,430
of document that so you could hear a little bit of that discussion modules is kind of a new way to do

75
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,110
things.

76
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,480
And that's giving you your name spacing and that's giving you your package management and versioning.

77
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,910
But then we have the go work in the go path right to go past set your go workspace.

78
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,160
That's the old way and in the go workspace.

79
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,280
You had your Ben package source folders.

80
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,120
So my head those are kind of two separate things like oh I don't want to do anything in that area anymore.

81
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,090
That's the old way where I have my go path and then we talked about it in your account.

82
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,380
No it's fine it's there use it's your go folder you've got a pen folder in it.

83
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,790
Right.

84
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,310
Set your go Ben to that.

85
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,100
And so it could still use that folder is no big deal.

86
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:42,070
Would that have any complications if I had legacy code and I did want to like suddenly use my go path

87
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,540
workspace to that place should be not your bin folder it should be fine.

88
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,630
Have been folder files get overwritten fairly often and whenever you whenever you grab something new

89
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,960
that inexcusable.

90
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,150
So a pair programming does that all look good to you.

91
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,240
Yes.

92
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:03,820
And I think the only other thing that I would check is to actually confirm will confirm that afterwards.

93
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:11,830
So now I'm just going to exit and hit yes and hit enter and now I need to restart my terminal for that

94
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,240
to take effect.

95
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,620
That's the easiest way that I've found to do it and I could do go in V.

96
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,420
And now my go Ben is set to that location.

97
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:29,080
I just want to make sure that that location exists calm fairly confident does.

98
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,550
But to do that I'll copy this

99
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:40,790
and then just CV there yeah we're all good if I go up a level and allies.

100
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,830
That's my workspace.

101
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,430
And that is.

102
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,840
Yeah.

103
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,060
Good.

104
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,470
All right.

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,560
And so that's just a convenient location that's on your path that go right to yeah.

106
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,180
So it will install binaries there.

107
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,560
Yep.

108
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,520
So so now you're go install knows a little notes where she put that executable that it builds.

109
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,250
So if we actually take a look at what's in there right now

110
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,880
we've got those and when I do my go install and get that proto buff proto see Django which is this code

111
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,230
which is all proto see Django Reinhardt see Django process Django.

112
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,850
We're just getting this proto see Django.

113
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,370
And yeah.

114
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:30,200
So now and I do this install I should see that set into my then folder count load package cannot find

115
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,440
I don't need my H TTP.

116
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,060
You need to make sure your part.

117
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,960
You need to make sure you're in your go module folder.

118
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,710
So just because you want to make sure that you install it at the version that go mod is low key it has

119
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:49,820
pinned checks on you to go see CV documents and then googling project.

120
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,120
Yeah.

121
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,230
And then now and they should just get a job right.

122
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:09,230
Yeah just get a now let's look at the and now we could switch back to here and we can to save a keystroke.

123
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,120
Do that.

124
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,660
Now we have privacy jingo in the bin folder there.

125
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,140
Yep.

126
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,910
And.

127
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,390
And now just go mod tidy.

128
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,930
That's just to make sure that that that go on tidy is to make sure that your that privacy chain goes

129
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,800
in your co mod before before you install.

130
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,950
So so confirm this.

131
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,470
If it's not there do come on.

132
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,080
Tidy.

133
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,550
See that all again.

134
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,810
So so so use the wrong location should be a dot must be moved to.

135
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,490
So it should be moved up to right here.

136
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:39,820
Yes.

137
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,110
So.

138
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,540
So if it's if.

139
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,210
You need to make sure that privacy chain goes and you go mod that go my title is how you make how you

140
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,940
put it into that good mod if it has not yet been put there.

141
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,660
Because the two mines just automatically show that like you know modify it or put it in Yeah if it's

142
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,860
not there.

143
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,320
All right.

144
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:09,550
And a seedy CV documents going go project and go mod Heidi unnecessary at this point but hey did a little

145
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,250
bit of stuff.

146
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,150
All right.

147
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,590
So that's that's good that's getting it installed on a Mac.

148
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,130
I hope that was helpful to you and I hope those notes were helpful.

149
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:28,730
And we will see you tomorrow I'm going to go home and do some serious G.P.S. reading tonight.

150
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,260
So I have some things to add to the conversation tomorrow.

151
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,370
Daniel thank you.

152
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,380
It's a pleasure.

153
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,330
I appreciate doing this with you and learning with you and pair programming and teaching it's totally

154
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,080
it's it's really beneficial process you know.

155
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,280
Appreciate it.

156
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,990
See you all in the next video which for us will be to morrow anything you want add Sia.
