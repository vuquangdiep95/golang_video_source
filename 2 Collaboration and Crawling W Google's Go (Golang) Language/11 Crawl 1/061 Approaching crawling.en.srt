1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,680
So I'd like to keep all of this.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:08,670
It's kind of like I don't know my OCD of being a teacher I like to try to keep my curriculum very modular

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:16,140
eyes and very consumable I call it the 38 Special where each section you break you break your your course

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,110
into sections and each section should have three day videos in each video should be three to eight minutes.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,130
And so we just did a little bit of diving into get ahead and so I just made that it's own section.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,310
Those are the videos we just went through and I just creating a new section here where we're gonna go

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:42,170
through the crawl and this is an overview of solution number one that Daniel created.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,000
So he's going to walk us through that and he's just going to talk through what he is thinking this is

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,050
gonna go fast.

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,240
It's like the convertible ride through the countryside where you know we're just pointing it out Hey

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,940
look at that bar in there.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,690
There's a park over there is that nice and see the river down there and you might be like Wait I want

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,550
to explore that river more and and so this is just to familiarize yourself familiarize you with the

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,760
terrain of his solution and then we'll come back and do longer stops at each of those points if you

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,620
want to you know check them out more with us so you can understand them a little bit more.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,830
So this is an overview of solution number one.

17
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,880
Take it away Daniel.

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:24,350
Right.

19
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:31,070
So so my solution number one was to directly scrape the each team out.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,460
So when thinking to crawl data on any given Web site.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,750
So in this case we want to crawl all we want to get all the tweets in this conversation

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,860
with the the root the name the Twitter handle and be in the tweet itself.

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,450
That's that's basically all we were looking looking to get although we could also pull more data.

24
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,730
First thing to think whenever you go for something like this is is there an API that they provide that

25
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,800
can get this information.

26
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,780
So is there any Twitter API.

27
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,710
And yes there is a Twitter API.

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,830
No it does not actually help in this circumstance.

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,190
They don't actually have stuff to get all the replies to a tweet.

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,840
So in this case the API does not work out.

31
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,660
Oftentimes there is an API.

32
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:28,410
And so you can use the API that they provide and follow their instructions and it works out this case

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,600
that did not work.

34
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,690
That surprises me.

35
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,970
Yeah you have to buy it.

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,240
They only let some of their API is they have a limited number of calls.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,570
Yeah.

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,340
And you have to know the exact I.D. numbers and you've got a limited amount you can call it day and

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,520
they've got a faster pace one but only works like the last seven days.

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,450
And so it's it's there.

41
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,740
Twitter's API is actually rather confusing amongst API.

42
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,480
I've looked at several and Twitter's is one of the more confusing ones.

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,580
So but overall they don't have an API that helps for what we're trying to do which is get all the replies

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:08,110
to a particular tweet so second option is to crawl the team out your Web browser needs these shemale

45
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,420
to actually draw the page.

46
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:17,070
So it's got all the information so you can your program can go through that A.T.M. and find everything

47
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,970
you're looking for.

48
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,780
I think this is brilliant because it's like all the data's already being sent to you.

49
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,890
Yeah exactly.

50
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,430
Thank you for sending it to me let me do something with it.

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,100
So.

52
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,020
So step one.

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:34,110
So my first actual attempt at a crawler just examines the e-mail to find the data I want.

54
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:43,680
This should be your second resort because a lot of web crawler usually doesn't respect a web page the

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,220
way a human does.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,280
It will go way faster than a human would go through a site and go to many many pages and could overload

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,360
servers.

58
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,040
So you want to be careful in calling each e-mail to respect the server you're going to.

59
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:07,230
And most servers will have a little file just at the Domain at slash robots Dot T X T go to just about

60
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:16,170
any domain and we'll have this have a file here which basically defines what this Web site considers

61
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,890
respectful as far as crawling and so in this case.

62
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,170
Twitter's got a lot of list of what you or else you're allowed to access what the crawler.

63
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,050
Which ones you're not allowed to access.

64
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,460
If you go down to the bottom it's got a little list here saying don't make more than one requests per

65
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,680
second or wait wait one second between each request.

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,050
So just kind of general rules to follow that Twitter considers reasonable for a caller to respect to

67
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,720
keep their service working well for humans which is what the sites mean the for.

68
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,340
Quick quick disclaimer we're not attorneys this is not legal a legal advice.

69
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:00,440
So if you get yourself into hot water this is what we're going to show in court right here.

70
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,460
All right.

71
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,710
So yes do be careful some sites don't like you crawling at all.

72
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,860
Yes you should check that out period.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,360
Well I don't know what the legal ramifications are.

74
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:20,160
You know violating terms of use and things like that lawyers don't always need valid reasons for launching

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,940
lawsuits.

76
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,390
Just know that at least in America.

77
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,800
So.

78
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,730
So Twitter's got a nice to grow robustly cheeks tea which is actually fairly generous for some sites

79
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,240
like this and so.

80
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,080
So I think you're OK.

81
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,720
So long as you respect that it should be OK.

82
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,680
Just call the team out.

83
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:47,520
So for a go there is a framework called Callie which makes crawling a shemale extremely simple and easy

84
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,910
and it automatically respects robots that takes so far.

85
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,610
That's awesome.

86
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,430
Don't even have to do anything if the site's got a robot that takes t..

87
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,890
Callie will obey what it says.

88
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,550
Yes this is super good to know about.

89
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:13,030
And in the in the desire to modular ize the course I am going to suggest that this is a good place to

90
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:19,600
end the first video just introducing Callie Yeah and and we'll rename overview of solution number one

91
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,240
or introduction introduction and I will introducing Callie but introducing.

92
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,650
We'll figure out the name of this video.

93
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,940
But we'll see the next video.

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,210
That's what we continue to see the next video.
