1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,240
So now we're just gonna ask Daniel a couple of questions about his solution and my first question that

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,050
came up when I was watching him present that was the CSA as class names like I'd expect there online

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:20,670
twenty five twenty six and twenty seven that like it would be able to find like if you're looking like

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:27,090
if you're going through the tax and you're looking for like tweet tax write it's looking through the

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:36,240
going from tweet to tweet Yeah it's looking through the year you're your attribute is class and its

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,290
value is set to tweet text.

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,190
I say that right.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,360
I haven't done it yet.

9
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,270
So classes it's all right.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,480
One of the classes in the list of classes.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,830
Yeah.

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:53,460
So so yeah their span is your tag classes that tribute and in the value values the entire list is the

13
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,660
is an entire list.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,200
But within that list you have tweet text.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,430
There's one user name.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,090
So yeah.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,540
For that one's usernames.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,650
You stay there.

19
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:01,850
All right.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,230
So there's tweet tech so it found tweet text in there and then for user name I would I would kind of

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:14,760
expect this to look at like okay inside user name I almost need to I almost need to put in user name

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,870
space you dashed or like maybe just put in all of that.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,800
You will find that like it's a little surprising to me to see that it did the CSF specificity.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,720
That's the best way I have to explain it.

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,940
So where you have like the nested stuff as a selector like this is out CSF selectors work.

26
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,470
You say this is a child.

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,260
Yeah.

28
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,490
I didn't use the child select subsets so that interest in that.

29
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,800
So what I'm doing is actually the child parent child thing I'm saying account name.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,540
I'm looking for full a class full name and one of the parents has a class of account group.

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,600
So what Todd is seeking up is instead of I could use her name and then I could also do dot you'd Aster

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,830
because that's in there but is actually respecting that CSF.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,670
So this this would add more specificity but what I'm not looking for is I'm not trying to disintegrate

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,660
between some CSX overwriting some other C assess what seat with it.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,970
I'm just trying to find all user names.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,580
Yeah but I don't want the user names that are out here in the message itself.

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,090
So that it may have its own.

38
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,850
If I inspect to this particular user name it might be the same.

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,440
I think it's got you there as well.

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,230
So yeah.

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:37,120
So just one thing I had noted though was that the top bar on every single tweet was account group.

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:37,820
Yeah.

43
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,920
And so that was something unique I could use to kind of narrow in on user name the particular username

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,700
I was looking for.

45
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,840
Yeah.

46
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,950
So that surprised me.

47
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:55,050
Where did that's in the documentation of how Cawley works that it does that that it's it's documentation

48
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,490
on a shemale it's looking for a go query selector which was.

49
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:02,970
This one.

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,620
Yeah.

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,270
And so go query when I went to it

52
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,640
CSF selector library.

53
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:18,970
Yeah.

54
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,590
And so it's the C is s select your library syntax why it's close.

55
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,480
Possible query.

56
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:32,790
OK that's interesting and then my next question was just a reflection on.

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,340
But like wow college is free.

58
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,270
That's a really well put together.

59
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,870
I think we use the word use the word library right.

60
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,150
But you can also Yes and it's an open source project.

61
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,010
Yeah.

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,280
And so for a terminology like first that that you know it's open source.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,960
So so if you go over here you can actually see the license fee what you use.

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,360
This is what you have to obey to use it.

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:06,720
Nice and you know a question to which hundreds stars Nice to see which is this says Callie says you're

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,510
allowed to use it for just about whatever.

67
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,170
Just don't try to trademark it.

68
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,970
The creators aren't liable.

69
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,270
They don't give any warrant.

70
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,270
Yeah that's nice.

71
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,000
I like that summary.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,210
I forget the other thing I was going to say and the next question was did this did this get all the

73
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,970
tweets because it pulled down 19.

74
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,150
But it seemed like there's a lot more so in this case.

75
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,980
No it did not.

76
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,570
And that's because Twitter does not actually give you all of the tweets immediately.

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,060
When I scroll down to the very bottom of the page you see it loads more infinite scrolling Kazan and

78
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,160
and so to do that.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,710
That's what you did with solution number two.

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,310
So my second solution was me solved that.

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,940
We'll see that in the.

82
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,170
Coming up at some point we might go through this in a little bit more.

83
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,420
But do you have anything else you want to add any other reflections on.

84
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,620
No that's our colleagues Callie's very nice and I recommend you use it if you're using go and try to

85
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,600
make it crawl.

86
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:18,860
Do you want one of the things I like about you Sally that felt felt for her.

87
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,180
But like when I ask you if you have anything more you say no.

88
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,590
And then very often you're like however check this out.

89
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,330
I like that are something often more comes.

90
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,660
That's cool.

91
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,120
All right.

92
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,310
So that's that's it.

93
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,360
Anything else.

94
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,140
This time for real now you do the same for real.

95
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,450
All right.

96
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,040
See the next video it's five o'clock.

97
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,310
So we're gonna head home and then we'll be back tomorrow.

98
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,130
Yeah.

99
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,980
We'll be back tomorrow to do some more.

100
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,430
See you then.
