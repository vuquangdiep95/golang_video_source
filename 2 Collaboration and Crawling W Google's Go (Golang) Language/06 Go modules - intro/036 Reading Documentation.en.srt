1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,050
Room vroom vroom.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,350
All right.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:10,390
So right after this video we're going to show you how to use modules we're going to get going with go

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,930
modules.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:17,560
But I just want to give you some documentation resources and one of the places you can look for.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,310
Go modules documentation is the go to Ling blog.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,160
So that's a great resource.

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:29,740
If you go there and then go to the blog index you'll find articles on modules you could see module Mir

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,890
and check some database launched and stuff like that migrating to modules and then down here using go

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,790
modules.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,680
So a lot of the curriculum we're going to teach you is built off of using go modules right here just

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,020
because they have excellent examples.

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,230
And we thought if we paralleled this blog post you'd be able to later come back and reference this blog

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,390
post and easily sort of synthesize the information because you've been exposed to it.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,660
So that's one of the resources for documentation.

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,880
Another resource for documentation is the go command.

17
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,240
And one of the ways you can learn about that is coming here to do that a little bit slower going dot

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,930
org then go to documents and then command F to search the page and I'm searching for command on the

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,180
page and if I come down I see command documentation.

20
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,710
And so here's documentation for different go commands.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm going to go to the go.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,160
Command right there.

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,140
And if I command F to find a word on this page and search for module you could see all the different

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,370
places modules modules module or talked about on this page.

25
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,750
That's good to know about.

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,960
And then the last resource I'm going to give you for documentation is here at the terminal if I type

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,190
go help I get help for the go command.

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,350
And here are here's the usage.

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:54,310
And so the usage is go and then pass in the command and arguments and the commands are and here a different

30
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,650
go commands including go mod.

31
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,420
So we're gonna learn about that.

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:04,800
And plus I could use go help command to search for help on this command or any of these commands.

33
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,210
So I could do.

34
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,040
Go help M O D.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,050
Go help IMO D.

36
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,720
And this is going to give me help on.

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,330
This is where I typing go help anybody.

38
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,410
This is gonna give me help.

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,960
On the Go mod command.

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,690
So I'm going to go back to go help and take a look at the rest of this and we just looked at this stuff

41
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:22,990
here.

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:29,260
Go command the commands are and there's the go mod command and go help command for information about

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,140
a command and then additional help topics.

44
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,680
And down here we have these module things there and go help topic for more information on this topic

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,860
so could you go help modules and you already saw that in a previous video or any of those other things

46
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,620
related to modules and I could read about that.

47
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,140
There is also a good up mod help topic to a little bit of to mod help topic up there.

48
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,130
So there's there's a lot of new documentation here around modules because it's not a small deal to have

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,020
good dependency management.

50
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,590
So that's the documentation.

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,780
Just want to make sure that you have access to it.

52
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,600
Anything you'd like to add.

53
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,400
No.

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,810
Nope.

55
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,070
There's there's a lot of blog posts about good modules though because it was such a big deal so you

56
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,920
can also just search go modules and you'll find plenty of medium articles to explain how to use them

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,040
or in the nuances behind it too.

58
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,910
But after these videos you should be fine.

59
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,880
Yes.

60
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:32,090
And last thing I'm going to say here is there's a link here for semantic versioning.

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,370
So there's a way to do software versioning where when you look at the versions it has meaning.

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,120
And I believe we talk about this further and if not we will talk about it further and if I don't have

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,310
a deeper dive OK deeper dive we go into semantic version versioning so you can learn about that but

64
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,530
there's a link there to read about semantic versioning and then also a concept that's really important

65
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,520
to all of this is name spacing.

66
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,780
So here is a link to name spacing and so name spacing just means that we use names to identify things

67
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,700
in the real world.

68
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,110
That's how humans work.

69
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,270
And then we also use names to identify things we actually call them identifiers.

70
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,940
It's another word we can use to refer to them.

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,220
You know encoding and so a namespace means that like here is a way that we could say this is where this

72
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,550
stuff lives.

73
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:27,430
And so you know one namespace might be like a get hub account get hub dot com user name and then repo.

74
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,730
Right.

75
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,260
That's a namespace and that's not going to conflict with anybody else's namespace.

76
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,390
So you might get help.

77
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,050
Use your name is different than Daniel's GitHub user name.

78
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:43,510
So even if our repo names are the same the namespace dick get hub dot com username repo name is going

79
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,570
to differentiate R and R repos.

80
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:55,510
And so this idea of name spacing that things have unique names is also important too important to using

81
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,290
packages and modules and not having the names conflict.

82
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,650
So that's that's a little bit about go notation for modules.
