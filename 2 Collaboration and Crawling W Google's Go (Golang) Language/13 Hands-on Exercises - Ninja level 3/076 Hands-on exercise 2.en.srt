1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:00,740
All right.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,910
Welcome to hands on Exercise number two.

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:10,980
And for this hands on exercise use go Cauley and crawl the go Ling Reddit site and I forgot to start

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,710
my own B.S. and so I'm going to start my own B.S. and this is why we do pair programming impaired teaching.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:23,790
So now you can see my screen you can see go Callie there and and crawl they go laying Reddit site so

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,750
go see what you can do to get that to work and positive video go do that when you're all done now y'all

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,740
come on back and I'm positive video and I'm going to take a swing at using go Callie never used it before

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,860
in my life and you'll see that after you do your solution so positive video go dears when you're done

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,070
come on back on opposite end you can see my solution which I'm gonna do right now.

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,460
So the first thing you'd want to do is drop that into the validator or a robot start texting validator

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,520
and here I have it going and just test it and it says yep you're allowed to do that next thing go the

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,920
go Lane Callie you know Web page go to docs and what we kind of what I learned from Daniel what we've

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,470
learned from Daniel was go down take a look at the examples there's actually a Reddit example and so

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,080
a good starting point is just to see if get this run so I copied including all of red I just want the

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,170
code so I'm gonna grab that code and bring it over to my editor and then paste it into my editor and

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,110
then I could do a quick read through of the code and when I do that I see that it's like an old read

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:35,730
it and so I'm going to see what I'm going to do is see if when I go to going read it here if I can bring

18
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,150
up the old read it and.

19
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,510
And right there I've got that I'm going to change it from WW W to old and see if there's an old read

20
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,770
it that comes up and an old read it did come up and it looks a mite easier to crawl and so I'm going

21
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,680
to add this in as a hint to your hands on exercise Yeah take a look at

22
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,620
the old read it and so noticing the difference there and so I want to crawl the old read it and then

23
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:14,050
also as I look through the code there's going to be some place where it's asking for OS ARGs and so

24
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:21,880
on going this is command line argumentation and so I'm going to try pasting in this old read it old

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:29,320
read it where did it go old read it you are Al right there as the you are all that I want to crawl in

26
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:37,930
my argument and so here's the code here's my terminal and I'm going to put in go run main dot go and

27
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:48,120
paste in the URL of the old code and see if I get any type of result and so now it's starting to crawl

28
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,250
and get some results out which looks promising so we'll let this run for a second and maybe fast forward

29
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,540
or edit pass this

30
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,600
and there it crawled for a bit and then brought some things out and I could kind of look through here

31
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:11,070
it's quite a bit of text to see what came out but that's the first step in my solution is just seeing

32
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,170
if I can get that example to work the next thing that I would do is I would go through here and I would

33
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,620
try to understand the code and so to understand the code I'm going to need to go to the documentation

34
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:32,720
and so Callie's documentation if you go to go talk and you search for Carlie you could find the documentation

35
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,010
here you have go calling you have Cawley and one of the things that you'll notice in the code I would

36
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:46,130
start going between the example that works here is the example that works one in you know in the code

37
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:51,410
we're creating a item struct and getting different items and then we're going to have a slice of those

38
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,140
items and these will be the different stories but one of the first lines is to create a new collector

39
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,940
and so I want to understand what this collector part is and I remember that from Daniel's code and so

40
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,800
I'd come in and I'd take a look at what the new collector is it gives me a pointer to collector when

41
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,940
I have a pointer to collector I have all of these methods available right there and and so I get a new

42
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,300
collector see and then I'm starting to use some of those methods like on each email on each email limit

43
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,620
on request and so I'd want to go through and take a look at each of those and and see what each of those

44
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,250
do.

45
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,550
And then also I have it here.

46
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:30,930
Right.

47
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,630
It's a visit only domains old Reddit dot com.

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,180
There's a few options that got set in there and so new collector and I have options an unlimited number

49
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,200
of collector options.

50
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,600
I'd also want to understand collector options and to understand collector option I could click click

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,650
what it did right there click right on the you know link for this item it takes me to it but then I

52
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,220
could collect on collector option it tells me what to collect your option is.

53
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,950
And so I'd go through all of the code like that and I don't want to take the time to do it here because

54
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,460
it's all already been demonstrated and explained.

55
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:15,080
And we're running at about seven minutes on this video but you could go through and start to explore

56
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,770
all of that in that fashion to see see what it has to give to you.

57
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:27,800
Maybe I'll do some of it so that the new collector collector options when I point click on new collector

58
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,950
go back to collect your options type collector options is a function and gives you a pointer to a collector

59
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,500
and a pointer to a collector has all of this information here.

60
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,470
So it starts to get in kind of deep but we could see here we have Colley allowed domains and Callie

61
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,520
async so I might look for where is allowed domain show up and allowed domains is a function here.

62
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,470
It's a collector option.

63
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,300
Right.

64
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:03,920
And then that allowed domains function gives me back a collector option and and so when allowed domains

65
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,740
Callie allowed domains gives me back a collector option.

66
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,830
Oh and then Callie async is going to give me back a collector option.

67
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,610
So if I look for caller async right.

68
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,940
This gives me back a collector option.

69
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:28,180
And what and what a new collector takes is a backup here at the top.

70
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,540
New collector takes a bunch of different collector options.

71
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:33,870
Right.

72
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,420
So new collector takes in a bunch of different collector options and so anything that gives me back

73
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,400
a collector option is something that I could pass in there.

74
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:50,190
So I could do a command C to copy that command after fine command V to search and I could start to look

75
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:58,290
through what is returning a different collector option and a collector option sets an option on a collector

76
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:05,490
type collector option underlying type as a funk that has a pointer to a collector.

77
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,750
And so if I when I clicked on that is kind of taking me into you know more and more depth but to use

78
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,540
the code what I need to know is that new collector takes into anything that returns a collector option

79
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,080
or anything that is of any value of type.

80
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,560
Collector option.

81
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,430
And so when I search for values of type collector option I could start to see.

82
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,870
Right.

83
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,900
Allow your RL revisit allowed domains async in the naming of this makes sense because this isn't this

84
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,770
is like options for collecting and the options that we're using here are allowed domains in async.

85
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,750
And so it's kind of a different way to think about that.

86
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,920
Do you have anything you want to say Add to that.

87
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,040
Yeah it's a good way to.

88
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,960
So when you create a structure you use a struct little to create a struct you can pass and all the options

89
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,370
but this doesn't work.

90
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,660
If you're creating a strict but a rule that has private values it's well that need to be set.

91
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,530
So this collector option thing is actually fairly common amongst bigger projects to have a way to kind

92
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,720
of preset public arguments on a struct that also has private arguments that need to be set by the new

93
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,560
function nice.

94
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,950
So it's a new collector or it will set some private private fields in the collector as well.

95
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:29,300
And then collector options is a nice way to easily set those public options to yeah.

96
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,110
So we've got our new collector with some options.

97
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,060
And once we have our collected then we go into on each team Al and we already saw that in Daniel's video.

98
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,170
And so that's where we start to look for the different class names and read it and we use our inspector

99
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,570
tools to do that.

100
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:53,750
And so in here launch Inspector tools and get this little icon right there and then I could start to

101
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:00,770
look at each of these stories and try to figure out which how do I grab just that story right there.

102
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:06,860
And looking at what the tag is and so they've already figured this out that it's a top matter.

103
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:13,730
And then for a top matter it's going to bring out the source title story you are all different items

104
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,430
like that through there.

105
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,090
So this is actually a little bit more involved than I think could be done in 12 minutes.

106
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,310
Takes a little bit of time but nice to look at the example.

107
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,510
Anything more you want to say about this.

108
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,820
No.

109
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,120
All right.

110
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,260
It's a little bit of hard hands on exercise for me to demonstrate a solution in just 12 minutes because

111
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:44,380
it does take some time to do that but that's my start at my solution for creating crawler using Callie.
