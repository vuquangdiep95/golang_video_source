1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,700
All right we did a little function over the night.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,340
We did a little bit of thinking or I don't know if this happens with you but like you think I'm not

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,170
sure what needs to be done Max.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,360
You go home and you can't sleep and then you wake up in the middle of the night and you go and you get

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,380
like Brad you make like one of those sandwiches and you eat and then you're sitting there at the kitchen

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,160
table and you're like I don't know if I could go back to sleep and then you're like I totally know we

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,090
need to do it tomorrow.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,950
And like the solution comes to you like 3:00 in the morning when you can't sleep.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,880
And and so we really heard a strong positive response from a lot of people about G.P.S..

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:43,770
And so that is coming up but I also realized that we haven't done hands on exercises and hands hands

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,320
on our exercises are essential so we're first going to jump any hands on exercises and then we'll do

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,560
a little bit of a just kind of two or three G.P.S. and kind of get you going with GOPAC it's not going

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:03,840
to be the full like comprehensive you are now the master jet I see it's not going to be that it's going

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,510
to be like this is how you start using it and this is what it is.

15
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,010
Let me see that reverse order actually.

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,210
This is what it is and this is how you start using it and and and then that's gonna be it for this course

17
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,120
we found the name for the course finally we realized that it all kind of fits together collaboration

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,940
and crawling really like that name Daniel came up with it it's great on going modules get GOPAC and

19
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,630
scrape and Twitter and if that doesn't sell you know cause I don't know what does because I like students

20
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,980
like I heard collaboration crawling I'm like that's the perfect name for the cause.

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,550
All right.

22
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:48,160
But now onto hands on exercises and we're at ninja level 3 which is great.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,160
And the first hands on exercise for this hands on exercise determine whether or not this U.R.L. can

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,730
be crawled and that you are Allah's right there so go ahead and pause this video and using what you've

25
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,820
learned in the previous videos that you watched about like validating and checking whether or not you

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,730
could crawl go figure out whether or not you're allowed to crawl this this you are all and pause video

27
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,250
could do that when you're done come on back now y'all and we'll show you our solution which we're going

28
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,800
to do right now.

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,160
All right.

30
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:31,020
So for this solution I remember the thing that really stands out to me is we want to do a crawl checker

31
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,480
like we Google crawl checker or something like that online Web site crawler check Web site.

32
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,400
That's not quite what we Googled.

33
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:47,120
So go back to the outline and I look for checker robots that text validator robots that t t checker.

34
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,470
Right.

35
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,670
And so we're going to drop that in there.

36
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,670
And when we dropped that in there we'll get a bunch search results.

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,280
But we can go to this one here so I'm just going to at the same time popped out open and the one that

38
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,150
I want to check is that read It's funny your url.

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,410
So can we crawl this.

40
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:12,100
I'm going to grab it and I'm gonna drop it in and paste it and then scroll down and live.

41
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,970
Ed you want to pasted into the url box.

42
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,360
There you go.

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,730
Peace in the url box and add it in.

44
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,320
You need to get the robots that takes t input to that button bigger box blue.

45
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,600
Oh it's all making sense.

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,050
So I go to read it dot com and then robots Dot T X T grab it.

47
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,420
And if you hear that little bell in the background that is sweet music to my ears because my favorite

48
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,160
cookies are about to come out of the oven.

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,230
I'll give you the recipe to at the end of this video.

50
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,510
All right.

51
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,020
So now I've got that and I'm going to crawl it as I have to choose one calling it out I'll do anything

52
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,350
I have my guide here you see just the very bottom it's just the general and all right since we're making

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,380
our own so.

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,140
So this is good that I'm doing it because it's one thing to watch it and it's another thing to be like

55
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,580
Oh I totally understood all that.

56
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,170
Wait a minute.

57
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,780
I know nothing.

58
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,860
How do I act.

59
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,200
So I put in the you are all I want to crawl there I choose who I'm going to crawl it as user agent.

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:24,250
It's always struck me as such a weird name but it's the basically the in client server it's the client

61
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,310
is referred to as the user agent right.

62
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,310
Kind of it's one of those more cookies or the browser.

63
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:30,540
Yeah.

64
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,900
The browsers agent.

65
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,410
Yeah.

66
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,560
The browser is the agent of the user.

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,020
Yeah.

68
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,710
Acting on behalf of the user.

69
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,900
I'm here to ask the good questions and and then we do live Ed the rest that's good.

70
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,620
Yes.

71
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,480
Just a test and great successfully completed result allowed and it's allowed.

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,550
And I think that a good service that we might be able to build when we get into the next course or the

73
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,850
next next course where we're building a web app would be maybe a robot stock text tester that always

74
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,810
returns.

75
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,750
Oh you could crawl this.

76
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,130
It won't be accurate.

77
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,590
But people always like the result.

78
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:06,910
All right.

79
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,050
So that's it for my solution to this first hands on exercise we could crawl it.

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,890
I know Daniel has something kind of funny and interesting to show you about.

81
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,330
I guess we'll just do it on your machine about the Reddit robot start to 60 and then I'll show you the

82
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,850
recipe for those cookies.

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,180
So let's do those two things

84
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,380
so yeah.

85
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,720
Some robots the teeth teeth.

86
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,820
What different user agents have different levels of allowances like they might be more generous.

87
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,150
Google search with the Google bot because they know that is what searches too.

88
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,630
But sometimes some of the user agents can be a little funny like Voltron.

89
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,040
That's an anime out there.

90
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,970
It's a TV show Voltron is not allowed to call anything disallow slash.

91
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,070
Yeah.

92
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,890
So I thought that was pretty funny about one.

93
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,110
It's been the that.

94
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,500
And this one is like really a lot smaller than other ones.

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,620
Yeah a lot of wins are usually or giant.

96
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,970
Yeah it's like here is that all all user agents here's their list of rules.

97
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,990
Yeah that's cool.

98
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:17,090
And that's just the Web convention conviction convention Chan Java robots Dot T X T right at the root

99
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,430
of a site that file there.

100
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,070
So on sites that know what they're doing which is larger sites they shared at least you could find that

101
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,670
robots T T at that location just in case you didn't know that.

102
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,040
All right.

103
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,710
Last thing tell personal anecdote.

104
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,790
No coding for your rush.

105
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:40,010
You could go to the next video is Jose's oatmeal peanut butter chocolate chip cookies right here.

106
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,700
Best cookies in the world if you're on to peanut butter and chocolate.

107
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,580
These are amazing like a really good thing to learn.

108
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,310
All right.

109
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,090
See in the next video or do the next hands on exercise.
