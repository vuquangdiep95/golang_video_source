1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,180
So we were just discussing what we talked about in the previous video and just wanted to make it clear

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,360
that when we checked out the files.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,220
So we're gonna talk about get ahead in this video.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And I'm gonna avoid making any unsavory jokes.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,830
And like that one.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,700
And

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,620
so now we're going to explore what what that means what head is and get.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,420
And

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,400
you know my brain is wanting to process.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,110
So that's.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,440
That's what we want to make sure.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,120
We just want to make it clear that when we are doing get check out I wasn't checking out from M. right.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:52,800
I was pulling from my kind of what I had in my machine the last state of where go mine and go somewhere

14
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,530
before I'd made you know here's where it was.

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,760
The Last Kind of like St..

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:06,060
Comet that was seeing it with you know my origin goes go goes to eleven going project.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,150
This is last comment on my computer.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,740
And then Daniel was also there at one point.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,110
So here's Daniel's computer here's my computer.

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,820
I got it like I'm just like it's such a visual person.

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,230
And Daniel's computer my computer each have a clone of Go going project Quick get your hand right here

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,180
you see this hand.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,530
Daniel's going project.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,820
Here's his computer here's my computer.

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,400
And at one point in time this morning when we started working it was all the same commit right.

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,380
And then Daniel made some changes and I made some changes and then we were kind of like you know we've

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,800
moved the code base forward from where I'm going project was.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,660
And then Daniel committed.

29
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:42,920
Right.

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,310
And his came over right.

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,880
So he's now aligned here but I haven't.

32
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,170
Right.

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,580
So my changes aren't in there.

34
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,750
So in some ways the commit I have on my machine this is up one more commit.

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,010
And so when I said get check out head my changes we're right here I went back and I checked out what

36
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,600
was here and.

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,120
And that align with the commit that we all had at one point which then meant that I could pull from

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,380
here because it saw oh you have work go something go modular at the last commit.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,850
And you know you're ready to move to the next commit we're go mine and go somewhere.

40
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,400
Did I explain that correctly.

41
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,610
Did that sound.

42
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,430
Not really.

43
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,030
OK.

44
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,310
You get your shot.

45
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,260
So.

46
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,480
So yeah.

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:33,720
So when when you get checked out on a file get goes back to the what it calls the head and it pulls

48
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,230
a copy of the file from the head.

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,840
So the head is wherever you are on get.

50
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,980
So if you're on a branch head is at the end of the branch if you're a master it's on the end of M. and

51
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,450
it's on your own machine.

52
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:56,210
It has nothing to do with get hub get hub has its own master head and such but your own machine has

53
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:04,400
a head and that's where you are in the get commit treat when you get checkout from a file you get goes

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,090
to wherever the last head was and copies the file from head over into your working tree where you actually

55
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,530
are writing code.

56
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:20,720
So Todd made changes to some to go man go some but the head was still back at the last commit.

57
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,380
Heads always are attached to a comet.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,640
And so he made the changes to go man go some in his working tree and then we did get checkout on those

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,880
files get went back to the head which just happened to be at the last commit on master that he had pulled

60
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,080
and it copied the files out into his working treat which then overrode all those changes and now his

61
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,030
status was showed the files had not been modified and to get pull could happen because the files had

62
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:53,250
not had no longer been modified so when I look at that at the terminal another way we just discussed

63
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,340
this right before this video is right.

64
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,270
Right now like Oh wow.

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,630
Because I changed a few things now I need to add these.

66
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:10,860
So we're just going to quickly add this get comet dash a and add Oh yeah get add sorry get add dash

67
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:26,050
a yes and get comet dash M and adds you know half completed scrape Todd and and then get push and now

68
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:32,770
Daniel going over to Daniel's computer let's get everybody's computers current here now Daniel could

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,650
do a get pull and there he's got everything on his machine.

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:46,940
Now if I do get status right I'm on branch master your branch is up to date with origin master and what's

71
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,800
your get stats look like on your machine.

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,790
So my guess is it isn't.

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,100
Yeah.

74
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,320
So I'm on branch pass through my branches up to date and I've got a workspace file which I'm not committing.

75
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,980
So that can be ignored.

76
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:57,390
All right.

77
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,480
And so is get ignore and get.

78
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,430
Yes.

79
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,120
Yeah we you could create a file can do that.

80
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,390
It's just at the root of your project.

81
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,740
The same place where you get file folders located.

82
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,240
You can create a file called dot get ignore.

83
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,470
Yeah.

84
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,450
And you can put in whatever you want in there and any it's a pattern matching.

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,950
So in this case I want Star not sublime workspace right.

86
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,220
Yes.

87
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,840
And now that's going to ignore.

88
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,740
Now if I get status it's now telling me only changes are get ignore it up man.

89
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,590
Let's push that up.

90
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,590
So another another.

91
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,970
So you usually want to have your workspace in there so another one that would be likely to get ignored.

92
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,710
It's like the V it's code workspace

93
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,700
so just in general anything if you've got any build files like if you like he I'm on windows so something

94
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,330
I will probably want to put in here is start out sexy.

95
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:58,320
I don't want any executable is to be put in in the repo accidentally

96
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,390
adds get your SO.

97
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,760
JUST if he files in the get ignore it won't let you add it.

98
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,320
It won't show up in the get status and the ad will ignore it.

99
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:11,590
Yeah.

100
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,450
Dad ignores it.

101
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:13,910
All right.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,110
So you just added that up and Bush and now I'm going to come back to my machine and I'm going to do

103
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:27,060
it gets that this and and so this has always been a little bit of a point of confusion for me it's like

104
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:34,030
hey I'm branch master your branch is up to date with G.M. It's not I'm actually behind or G.M. right.

105
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,360
Yeah.

106
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,230
What are your thoughts.

107
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,750
So it gets status tries to be fast so it doesn't actually talk to origin or beer at all.

108
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,100
It's just trying to do it all on your own machine for speed purposes and reliability too.

109
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,040
Yeah because get static get status and the can you can make myths about pushing them.

110
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,390
So I guess that's what's to be fast and efficient for that purpose so it doesn't actually talk to Origin.

111
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:02,380
So if you want you can do get fetch which get fetch just tells get to go check or join for what's up

112
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,700
to date.

113
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,790
So.

114
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,160
So it get fetch.

115
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,130
Now it knows more you.

116
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,110
But if you do get status now it tells you you are now behind.

117
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,190
Got it.

118
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,450
All right.

119
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,890
So we're going to also covered in this video videos dot get ignore which is good.

120
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:25,420
And it was covered in previous courses but new material here is get fetch and and then now.

121
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,710
Now when I did my get status I'm behind so I can do my get pull.

122
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,000
Yep.

123
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,830
So yeah I get pull also fetches because it's intended for the network access.

124
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,040
Yes.

125
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,680
So now everything's current again.

126
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:43,320
So if I do might get status and even if I did get fetch and then did it get status again everything

127
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,470
is is good.

128
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,780
So we're all good.

129
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:53,640
And that same on both and and then the next thing for us to look at is just to.

130
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,860
I wanted to look at get log.

131
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,800
And so here's here's kind of like one way that I was thinking about head when we were talking between

132
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,170
these videos was had is kind of like the cursor in a text document.

133
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,730
And so my cursor right here would be like right at this point.

134
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,000
Right.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,750
This is the last one that came came up right here.

136
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,650
This is the last comment from Daniel.

137
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,010
And you put that good ignore file in right there.

138
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,500
And so that's where my head is right here and you can even see it saying head is pointing to master

139
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,240
whether your thoughts on that syntax.

140
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,290
So it's just yeah it's just head head right now is an alias for Master.

141
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,670
Right.

142
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,900
So it's just pointing straight to master and and then if I move things forward so I'm going to control

143
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:50,860
C out of that rescue queue area and and just add some file.

144
00:08:50,890 --> 00:09:00,210
So I'll come back to this code and make some small change I'll break open up my last one and I'm the

145
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:08,970
end and do small change and I make sure that saved and then come back here and do get status.

146
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:15,370
And so now things have changed and your branches update with origin master changes not staged.

147
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:27,670
It's asking me to change those stages and so currently my cursor My head is right here but my code is

148
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,350
is a little bit ahead because I've added something and if I wanted to I could go and I could check this

149
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,040
file back out and checking it back out from ahead head which is this comment that more clearly said

150
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,590
and explained.

151
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,170
Yes OK.

152
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,960
I just want to make sure that that was clearly explained as explained what had was you everything you

153
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,110
want to add to that you can move head around freely you can get it get checked out of file number you

154
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,550
can get check out any branch number you can get check out any commit number so you can you can just

155
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,750
do it get checked out on say any like the previous comment number if you wanted here let's let's check

156
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,440
this out.

157
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,280
This video is getting a little long.

158
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,090
So we're going to continue this in the next video.
