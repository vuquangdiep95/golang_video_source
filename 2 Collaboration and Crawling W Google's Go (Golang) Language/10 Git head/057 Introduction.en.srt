1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,020
So as I mentioned this course we're kind of figuring it out as we go we knew we wanted to give some

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:14,610
more real world hands on examples about creating go projects but we also wanted to hear like we weren't

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,030
even sure like OK we want to do another go course.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,090
What should this go course to be about.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,450
And because I wasn't quite sure what it should be about.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:31,050
Increasingly my life I'm realizing the importance of market research and giving the market the economy

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,170
the marketplace giving the marketplace what it wants.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,550
Because if you're going to do an endeavor which you're hoping will find traction in the marketplace

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,910
will be valuable and beneficial to others that others will not only be beneficial to them and improve

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,060
their lives whether you're making some sort of a product for people to consume like ice cream or something

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,230
like that or you're making some software project or you're making a course.

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,010
Right.

13
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,600
Like providing what people want it's going to be more successful in the marketplace.

14
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,560
If you're if you give people what is wanted by the marketplace as opposed to creating something and

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,010
then trying to push it on the marketplace and create the demand it's much better to meet the demand.

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,820
And so because of that I thought well let's just find out what people are looking for.

17
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:27,310
And I told you when we were thinking about creating this course I went to Twitter and I posted so if

18
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:33,950
I go to my profile I posted a question to all the people on a lot of go programmers follow me.

19
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,120
I posted a question What would you like to see in the course.

20
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,920
And so creating a project based web dev go lane course need a web dev project create any ideas.

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,590
And so there is one hundred and fourteen likes and many different responses.

22
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,960
And so we thought what would be interesting next step for us in our course here is we've looked at get

23
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:02,980
essentials and get branches and then we looked at go modules and we did a lot of good stuff and go modules

24
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,390
and we had a hands on exercises for each of those.

25
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,260
We thought the next thing which might be interesting to look at would be to crawl these responses and

26
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,960
just to show how a crawler works and go and to pull out.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,850
There's my new puppy.

28
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,650
If you heard that bark pull out pull out those responses and then maybe do a little bit of analysis

29
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,150
on the text just word count or something like that see what some of the larger words are.

30
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,970
But the first step in that process is to crawl it.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,460
And so that's what we're gonna do in this next section or these next sections is we're going to take

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,870
a look at these crawlers.

33
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:45,010
And Daniel has put together two solutions and I haven't had enough time to put together an entire solution

34
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,510
myself.

35
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:53,080
But between the two of us you're going to see our individual takes on crawlers and you're going to see

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,040
our solutions and so that's what's coming up.

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,070
Do you have anything you want to add to that intro.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,040
No.

39
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,280
All right.

40
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,980
So pair programming and pair teaching here.

41
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,790
I am going to provide one personal anecdote here so if you're in a rush and you need to get gone you

42
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,330
could jump to the next video now or if you want to hear the personal anecdote.

43
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,220
So over the weekend Daniel already knows this.

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,960
Like over the last week my entire family has been hit with the stomach flu and it hit me on Saturday

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,380
night.

46
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,150
So Saturday night I was completely laid up in bed all day Sunday.

47
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:34,150
It's such a rare occasion like I can't remember the last time in my life where I just did not do anything

48
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,810
all day.

49
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,070
I just laid in bed all day.

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,860
That's not true.

51
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,400
I did a little bit of house pick up because that needed to happen.

52
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,610
So I was just walking slow and and they didn't eat it all Sunday and then Monday I was like I couldn't

53
00:03:51,940 --> 00:04:00,160
function and now today just back up and I even had to take a nap today and you've known me a long time.

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,550
How many times have you known we've been at maybe two or three times over the years you've known me.

55
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,630
So I was like I guess I could take a half.

56
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,320
So yeah.

57
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:14,680
Anyhow that happens life happens and I'm not 100 percent but I'm game.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,620
So here we go and we'll see in the next video where we're going to jump in.

59
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,610
Taking a look at Daniel's coat.
