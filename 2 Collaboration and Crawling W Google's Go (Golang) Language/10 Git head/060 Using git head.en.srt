1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,720
So now what we're going to do is we're just going to demonstrate that once more like my code is a little

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,800
bit ahead of last.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,220
Check out the last sorry buy codes a little bit ahead the last commit.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,560
And so I'm going to check this file out and just bring it back to where it was here.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,590
And so I'm going to bring this down here.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,040
Copy that and come down to my terminal and get checkout dash dash.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,090
And then that entire file that path and this is where it's tree ish right.

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:37,230
Like here is the location that no treat tree issues to commit is some commit value according to gifts

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,440
like length how how we defines stuff a tree ish is a commit OK.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,400
I think you have directory tree but now when I do the get check out if I do might get status everything's

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,800
up to date because I rolled it back to I rolled that one file back to where it was at this point.

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,090
Back to had and if I look here that comment is gone.

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,940
So it's get checked out in action.

14
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,770
What else do you want to say about that.

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,190
Your head can be freely moved.

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,890
So right now head is pointing to master for Todd but he could just as easily do the get check out to

17
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,330
a branch and now his head to be over at that branch.

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,310
Another thing you could do is you can get check out a commit number.

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,350
So all the permits that show up with the gate log.

20
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,490
I could take a one of these commit numbers say I want to go back to this previous commit before they

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:41,470
get ignore I could copy that and get check out that commit no and this will give me a nice big warning

22
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,230
about how you are in a detached head state.

23
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,090
You can look around make experimental changes and commit them discard any commits you make in this state

24
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,910
without impacting any branches but if you actually want to retain the cadets you have to create a new

25
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,390
branch

26
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,890
so if you wanted to you could go back to.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,080
So right now I do the get logged and I could see my head is here and it's not pointing to master so

28
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,770
that's where you're currently working.

29
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,570
Yes.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,540
And you can create a branch off of that change and stuff submerge it back up further off line.

31
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,140
So so now I could create a branch off at this point if I wished with the get check dashboard.

32
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:30,210
Just like normal Mork often though you will do a get check out to a particular tag name too.

33
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:37,040
I could do it get checked out from this tag so previous head position was at this commit with this commit

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,460
message head is now at this commit with this message if I do get log see my head is now in here with

35
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,000
this tag and whereas the top log Oh it doesn't you don't see it.

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,390
Yeah.

37
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,390
You see this your lawyer there.

38
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:49,890
Yes.

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,010
Like the top.

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,430
Yeah.

41
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,400
Three four four.

42
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,230
So how do you get back up to the top.

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,960
So now see I can just do get branch to see again here it also says head is here the star and it's green.

44
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,930
It's not at Master.

45
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:07,670
So I can just get checkout back to master and now I get log shows.

46
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,440
My head is set now.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:08,720
All right.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,070
So it's almost it creates its own branch when you move your head to a different one kind of except you

49
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,160
can't really you you can you can go you can move your head back or to a tag and you can make commits

50
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,630
and you step with them.

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,170
But as soon as you go away from that point go back to master something.

52
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:24,350
Yeah.

53
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,770
You can't really get back to those committees anymore you don't.

54
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,300
You don't know how to.

55
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,230
There's nothing labeling that content anymore.

56
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:30,530
Yeah.

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,330
So you know if you but if you go back to another thing and then you create a branch off that point you

58
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,850
now have a name to that to your work off that point and then you should merge that back in the master

59
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,360
if you want it.

60
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,710
Yes OK.

61
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,310
So if you wanted to kind grab something from an old code base an old comment that would be how you do

62
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,400
it.

63
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:49,940
Yeah.

64
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,720
And then bring it.

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Yes let's go get that thing we threw away we actually needed that or commits ago.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:54,990
Yeah.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,910
You come back there and come back there grab the file create a branch and emerge back to master.

68
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,490
Interesting.

69
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,630
All right.

70
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,070
I hope that was helpful.

71
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,790
Anything more you want to add.

72
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,650
No.

73
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,510
Is it me or is it getting a little bit hot in here.

74
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,780
I think you're doing all right.

75
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,680
All right.

76
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,790
See in the next video.
