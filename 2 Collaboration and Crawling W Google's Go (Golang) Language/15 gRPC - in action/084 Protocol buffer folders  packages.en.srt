1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,930
So two things for me that kind of came up as questions as protocol.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,910
Buffer I think.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,220
JASON Yes.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,580
Does that get good association.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,050
Yes.

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,530
And the other one is.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,550
You know I think it'd be good just to have a little bit of a discussion of package name versus folder

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,630
name cause folder name could be totally different than package name.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,690
And you could even have one folder with many different packages in it.

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,320
Correct.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,350
Well I know all go files within a single folder must have the same po.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,860
Oh go will actually give you an error or if you've got a different package name amongst go files in

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,080
a folder so you can have some folders underneath that with different package.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,660
OK.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,480
OK.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,110
Okay.

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,920
That's right.

18
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,880
That's it.

19
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,870
And.

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,280
And just as you would go to there.

21
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,280
Okay.

22
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:48,930
So you just.

23
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,510
That is actually the folder name.

24
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,340
And it's just a best practice to have your folder name match your package name.

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:56,760
Yes.

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,170
Because when you import import by default you normally you can either define the package name manually

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,830
how what you're going to call it or it's based on the tax shame and what you're importing.

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,640
And so if that just matches the last one of the folder name that's easy for people to remember when

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,460
they're importing say all that again that went past me.

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,010
So it's like when I'm importing this stuff this proto thing.

31
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,030
Yeah.

32
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,190
If it grabs it from the older which is the same deal.

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,250
So it's actually whatever the package they list is.

34
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:32,300
So if that matches the folder path that's easy to remember yeah yeah but where does it get.

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,040
That has an alias there.

36
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,620
So in this case it's got legal aliens in them.

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,070
Right.

38
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,460
And if you don't have the alias it call you call it from the package name not the folder name but then

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,530
it's easy to associate if you have your folder or package.

40
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,720
So it's best practice.

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,130
Yes.

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,500
Temp folder named to package.

43
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:48,820
OK.

44
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,210
That's a that's a nice clarification.

45
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,910
I hope that that helps.

46
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:59,000
Those are my two reflections on Daniel's previous video compiling the service and the next video.

47
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,690
We've got some special planned for you.

48
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,390
I'm not sure what it is but I'm looking forward to seeing it.

49
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,610
See the next video.
