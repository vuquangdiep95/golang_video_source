1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,440
So here's our game plan for this video.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,230
We're gonna get this up and running on my machine we're going get it running I'm Daniel's machine you're

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,230
gonna be able to see it running on both machines I'm just checking our clock and and then I also just

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,960
wanted to convey that there's two more pieces and so one piece is that this is kind of this is a media

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,750
example just took us I don't know 12 15 16 minutes and two videos took him that long to explain just

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:33,420
to sort of sit here just watch it and and and so we're not going to go through and explain every piece

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:33,780
of this.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,820
You did get a more detailed explanation with the earlier GAAP example that we did where we walked through

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,330
all that and but with this one it's just something meaty an example the works that you could sink your

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,680
teeth into if and when you are ready for it.

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,680
And then what we will do though at the end of this video or maybe the next video depending upon how

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,650
long it takes us to kind of show it working is we're going to trace a message through the code and you'll

13
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,850
kind of see our message passes through the code.

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,070
So that will give you a little bit more insight into the code.

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,810
So the first step is to get it up and running on my machine and I've got all of my code here.

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,050
I'm not current SO I'M JUST GONNA MAKE SURE THAT I'M IN THE going project I'm going to do it get status.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,270
Of course they'll tell me a little bit of information and so do I get PULL AND AND NOW IF I DO MY get

18
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,160
staffs all should be well that's some voodoo computing there for you.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,270
And now that I have that code down here how do I get this up and running.

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:38,930
I need to go into this folder right into the chat folder yet so C.D. into your 0 5 0 0 5 0 4.

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,640
Yeah.

22
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,300
And then what I want to do that you're going to want to be in the client and so.

23
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:51,350
So over on my machine I will open up I'm in the 0 4 server.

24
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,410
I'm just gonna go run the server

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,160
now serving at Port 880 and I'm going to run the client ready for that.

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,490
So.

27
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,620
So in the client it's go or I may not go.

28
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,290
And it takes two arguments.

29
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,520
So the first argument is where to connect to.

30
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:21,350
So I'm on my computer and we use IP config on windows and my IP address is that 10 0 0 0 24 0 0 24.

31
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,430
Colon 80 84 88.

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,160
And then space.

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,370
And then what you want your username is going to be on this chat message.

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,630
So that's the hardest part.

35
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,290
So so you don't have GRC and all the various libraries.

36
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,580
Yes.

37
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,180
So it's go modules is automatically grabbing all of that for you.

38
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,800
Super nice.

39
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,240
Meantime on my machine I will do.

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:57,220
Go run main go in the client folder and I'm on my own machine so I can use local host 1880 and Daniel

41
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,760
for any

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,360
mind connected but over on Todd it says you've got the connection here.

43
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,710
And I think I knew what that it was actually.

44
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:16,260
It's my firewall it's windows blocking external connections so

45
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,160
Daniel's security conscious never.

46
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:28,230
So yeah he can rerun that command and it should work this time but it looks like it worked before you

47
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:28,600
cleared.

48
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,680
Yeah so it should I closed the server to restart it until the firewall.

49
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,830
So it should make this message here connection established a quick corrosive exit.

50
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,540
And now you can type in a message

51
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,420
and so it shows up there and it shows up on my machine and I can get something back.

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,280
Super cool.

53
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,660
Todd

54
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,560
is all working.

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,350
I love this.

56
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,930
So this is just the server is running on my laptop.

57
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,600
I'm connected with a client will close to my left to my own server and Todd's on his own machine next

58
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,230
to me.

59
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,260
And he typed in my IP address to connect to my server as well.

60
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,480
And so every time one of us types the message the server forwards it on to the other person or both

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,510
of us actually.

62
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,340
Yeah it's very cool.

63
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:31,550
Do we want to keep the video short so let's do the tracing the path of a message through the code in

64
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,540
the next video.

65
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,100
So this is just seeing everything running in the next video we're going to trace the path of a message

66
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,010
you anymore you want to add to this one.

67
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,660
Nicely done.

68
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,580
Nicely done.

69
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,950
Really cool.

70
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,870
See the next video.
