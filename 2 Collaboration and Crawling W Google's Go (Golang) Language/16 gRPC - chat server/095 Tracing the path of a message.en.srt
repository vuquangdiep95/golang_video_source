1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,620
So when do dealing with concurrency and networking like this one helpful way to understand the code

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,760
is to try to see if you can follow the path of a mess of an action through the code across the multiple

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,110
devices to understand it.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,490
So what.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,250
What we need to have is when someone types in a message it comes in on this function and then eventually

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,910
on every computer it goes to this fine print line.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,730
So but how does it get from this here to here is the question is climbs up.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:39,950
So so so following the path is a nice way to kind of see how that works.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,640
So the message comes in here.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,720
Got message and it comes down in here the message gets sent out through the stream to the server so

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,670
over in the server that comes back in here.

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,420
This received message.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,790
So on a connection through receives that's here's the message on the server what's best on the server

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:14,930
it comes down and gets sent out through this broadcast channel this broadcast channels other end is

15
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:22,020
here in chat server comes the message comes out the broadcast channel and then the server goes to all

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,560
the connections and for every connection it sends that message.

17
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,250
And so.

18
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,110
So now this the send is located up here connection.

19
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,060
This is just scrolled up a bit so it comes down here and it gets sent through to this send channel to

20
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,010
the send channel.

21
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,150
The other end of it is right here again in the connection.

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:53,060
So the message comes out here and gets sent through the actual connection so this then goes back to

23
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,070
the client up here the stream receives messages.

24
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:06,750
And now you get the message and it comes down and gets printed out a nice car I had so many questions

25
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,090
I don't even know if I want to jump into it.

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,730
Well done.

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,840
I'm not going to jump him to.

28
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:15,630
All right.

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,210
Anything you want to add to that now.

30
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,900
Good.

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,410
That's definitely code that's going to take even myself you know one of the we need the qualifier even

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,230
but that's kind of this can take myself a little bit of time to understand.

33
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,360
Thanks for that example Daniel really enjoyed it.
