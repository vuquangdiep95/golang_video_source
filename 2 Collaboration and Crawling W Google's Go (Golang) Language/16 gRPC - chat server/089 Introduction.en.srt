00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,600
It is Friday afternoon 324 P.M. and since I saw you last I went to the dentist.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,770
My teeth are still hanging in there and we all a breed that were the size of small redwood trees.

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,380
I didn't finish mine.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,160
I'm gonna save it for the winter in case I need to heat the house over a long cold winter.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,420
I'll have something to burn.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,710
But now we're going to jump in to Daniel.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,290
We are like.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,250
We'd like to give you a little bit more with that jar.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:36,800
P.S. And and we were looking at the different articles that are already out there talking about JROTC

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,050
with GO and different examples and one of the things that you know a G.P.S..

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,280
Let me just see if I have it here quick and handy GAAP c can't.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,480
Concepts.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,220
So just a second we'll edit out the slope PART.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,140
I'M LOOKING FOR.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,100
OH IS THIS THE STREAM stream stream.

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,420
OK.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,000
Cool.

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,450
Awesome.

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,210
Great.

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,390
And so you could set it up.

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,590
Where is just sort of call and response and then you could also set it up where you have a stream from

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,760
the client to the server.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,950
You could also set it up where you have a stream from the server to the client and you can also set

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,490
it up where you got streams going both ways.

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,030
And so there's four different ways that you could do communication between the client and the server.

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,910
And so we want to give you a little bit more of an in-depth example than something is out there.

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,030
And Daniel is really leading the charge on this.

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,270
I would like to be able to say that the student has become the master.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,970
That's absolutely true.

30
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:43,700
And but I'm I'm honored to have played a little role in your computer science education two of to have

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,170
been able to be your teacher but he's also done a ton of work on his own and taking a ton of other classes

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:49,960
of course.

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,580
But so anyhow and this is what we did.

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:01,350
Since the last videos Daniel with Daniel did as he explored what it'd be like to use TR he see I don't

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,380
know why I'm just tripping over that phrase for web dev and what that would look like and that actually

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,140
turned out to be a little bit fairly complicated a little bit too complicated for an example to present

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,770
here right.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,290
Yeah.

39
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,710
Yeah.

40
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:22,620
In the browser in up being too complicated involved multiple servers and translation calls and ended

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,200
up being complicated.

42
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,060
Yes that's a that's a work in progress not something we're going to present right now.

43
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,260
But what Daniel did put together was a little chat server and so in the next couple of videos and this

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,490
video is just an introduction to this new section here we have a G.P.S. G.P.S. chat server and so just

45
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,780
to give you a little bit of a grounding and anchoring in the course outline.

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:54,360
We did GOPAC Getting Started GOPAC in action and then we're going to have a G.P.S. chat server and so

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,090
the next couple of videos Daniel is going to introduce you to that and between the last section and

48
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,950
the last video in this section and this video.

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,820
I also did some reading on what we might be able to present to you and what's already out there.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,250
And so I really appreciated and enjoyed this article here from Nico Gua then.

51
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:22,290
I'm not quite sure how you say your last name Nico but I included a link there because I thought it

52
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,960
was a pretty cool example and a really well-written article with great descriptions.

53
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:36,060
Not to mention some really cool go for art of some of JROTC so that link there I think it's a worthy

54
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,440
article.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,200
Check out all right you have anything more to add to the intro video are you ready to jump into the

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
next videos where we'll start going through all this.

57
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,440
Let's get started.

58
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,580
All right see the next videos.
