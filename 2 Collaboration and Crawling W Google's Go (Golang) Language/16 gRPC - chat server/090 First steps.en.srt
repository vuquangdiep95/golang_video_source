1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,530
All right so do you start with any G.P.S. program.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,280
The easiest route is to look at the profile.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,230
So I've got here in 0 5 G.P.S. for a chat.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,750
I've got a chat folder with the chat dot profile.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,240
And as you see it's actually very fairly small.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,510
It's a very simple service protocol wise.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:33,660
So got the typical syntax was Pro 3 in the service chat with one or one remote procedure called Chat.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,430
But what this is different is that a chat can take in a stream of chat messages and returns back a stream

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,310
of chat messages so you can make a sharp as it's whenever you want and just keep going on the same chat

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,100
and the server can send back a string or chat messages when someone else chats just whenever.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,580
So both the input and output are going through streams and a chat message is defined as two strings

12
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,540
a user in a message.

13
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:09,640
So like a user name or and then the message they're actually sending and one of the things that's interesting

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,650
I'm sure maybe we did or did not mention this but it is definitely worthy of being mentioned is there

15
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,590
on line three through five in our interface definition language.

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,410
You know that's like almost defining an interface there where it's like hey if you're going to be a

17
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:34,540
service you got to have this RBC method where chat returns this chat takes in this argument and returns

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
that right.

19
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,180
All.

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,810
So.

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,620
So whenever you've got a stream in the input or output the the function that you defining go becomes

22
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,520
very different.

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,990
So if I go to the generated code there's chat message which is as usual just a plain struct if I go

24
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:03,450
all the way down to let's see where it's such that server a chat server the chat function is just takes

25
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:12,090
in a chat underscore a chat server which is a really interesting method which if I hover over that that's

26
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,010
just an interface they send and receive message because it's a stream.

27
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,580
It doesn't actually have everything that it's a stream both directions so it needs to be able to receive

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,180
a stream of chat messages and send a stream of chat messages.

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:37,030
And so it's not it's not like a request response RBC message takes in the entire message as an argument

30
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,000
and returns the terror response as an out those streams instead it gives you this interface to receive

31
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:50,550
and send individual messages within the stream and then it returns possible error for the actual controlling

32
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,540
of the overall connection.

33
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:01,920
So this is on this chat server side it was at your chat method will receive a chat chat server with

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,690
the send receive.

35
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:10,920
If I go back up to chat client when you when you make the call to initiate this RBC if you give it the

36
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,770
context and it returns a chat chat client which has got the same mouth to method send and receive because

37
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:23,170
they're both streaming because both in both directions are streaming nice.

38
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:32,100
So your process is step one create your profile and then step two is to build that profile compile that

39
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,780
profile down into your product is this your protocol buffer right here.

40
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:46,970
This is the generated code PDB so it's got to be got go and and then take once you generate your code.

41
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,110
Take a look at your code and start making sense of it.

42
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,270
That seems to be OK.

43
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:51,570
Yeah.

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:51,940
So.

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,720
So the formulas for how it spits out these particular interfaces is consistent.

46
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,810
So eventually you'll learn what they are and you can just look at the profile without generating code.

47
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:10,280
But when you're not that used to it yet the the code is very complicated but there's just a couple.

48
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,340
You can just search for.

49
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,640
Okay.

50
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,520
I'm looking for the chat function so I could just copy that search for chat and let's see where can

51
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,890
I find a chat interface.

52
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,440
So like there's a chat something or other.

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,230
Yeah.

54
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,000
So.

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,310
So I just want to look for the interfaces primarily.

56
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:35,100
And then what was the code that you at the terminal to compile your chat profile command.

57
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,090
It's a proto C dash capital I.

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
So that when they get older.

59
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,780
Yeah.

60
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:53,220
Well that's older and Cash Dash go out equals plug ins colon GOPAC plug no plug ins equals to your colon

61
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,000
chat.

62
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,090
Yes plug ins.

63
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,290
OK.

64
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,830
Cool also.

65
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,430
That's what generates it.

66
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,660
So that those are the first steps anything you want to.

67
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,710
Else you want to add to the first steps there.

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,990
Writing writing your profile and then also generating the code and then taking the first gander at understanding

69
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,430
it.

70
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:12,950
Yeah.

71
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,150
That's it.

72
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,260
I think that's a good first video we will see in the next video or we will explore this further.
