1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,410
So now I want to give you the course resources and so we've got a course outline here.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,430
And this folder here this link will bring you to the folder where anything that you see is used in the

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,320
course aside from GitHub will be in this folder.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,380
And then I'm going to add a link to get hub here as we start creating a code base that you could go

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,010
get the code.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,530
So you know that link will be there.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,820
And then here's a link to some of my favorite things people sometimes ask me for book recommendations

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,800
and so I have my coding books that I recommend for go.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:40,320
I have books that I've read about wisdom like Franz Kafka NO NOT THAT ONE LIKE A Man's Search for Meaning

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,580
by Viktor Frankl.

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:41,870
Right.

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,230
So Viktor Frankl man search meetings an amazing book.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,520
You know Michael Paul and how to change your minds really been one of my favorites recently smarter

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,450
faster better.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,460
So all those books are listed there along with I think I have some of my favorite movies and things

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,140
like that so you could check that out and then the course outline to get to those link.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,360
You see you need to come to the course outline and to do that.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,510
I'm going to because I realize right now that I didn't do this.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,230
I'm going to go to bitterly which is that link creator and and I'm going to click Create and you can

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,630
see I had an alias there James.

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,930
And so I'm pacing in that link and then it gave me a funny name so I'm going to customize the back half

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,430
and we're going to call this awesome coding.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,340
Why not.

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,700
And and and then I'm going to see if that clicks up.

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,130
Come on give me awesome coding.

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,490
Hey where'd it go.

27
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,850
Let's see if that worked.

28
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:48,530
Let's try going to bit Lee forward slash awesome coding.

29
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't know if it took you to copy that in case it worked.

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,530

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:09,120
We're in kind of a more of a dance class and or intermediate class and add a tile course outline.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,940
Maybe I need to have a title and working at an awesome awesome coding and there.

36
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:23,350
Come on man Click Give me up here and customize back half protip create bit links from any Web page

37

39
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,490
OK so I have to hit save.

40
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:37,770
All right.

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,390
There's awesome coding so if i paste in awesome coding bitterly awesome coding that's gonna take me

42
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,650
to the course outline.

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:52,360
So I'm just gonna drop that end right here that you could go to that you URL each TTP colon forward

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,930
slash forward slash B T dot l y forward slash awesome dash coding and you can get to this course outline.

45
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,290
All right.

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,940
So those are the course resources.
