1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:01,840
All right.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,830
Welcome to class.

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,460
I'm super excited you're here.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,150
And in just a moment I'm going to start getting you going with everything in the course I'm going to

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,040
give you the course resources I'm going give you access to an outline for this course I'm going to go

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,170
over my credentials because I think it's important when you take a course to understand a little bit

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,700
about the individual who's teaching you or the individuals who are teaching you and we're gonna have

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:32,000
two teachers in this class I'm going to tell you about that and but the first thing I want to do is

9
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,590
and if you've taken any of my other classes you know this is something I do at the beginning of all

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,110
of my classes including my classes at the college and the university is I'd just like to take a moment

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,520
and commend the students commend you for what you're doing because what you're doing is to me one of

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,300
the noblest of endeavors and so I just want to congratulate you for taking that first step to improve

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,120
your own life improve your own life.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,350
Gandhi said Be the change.

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,700
And when I was young Be the change right Be the change don't wait for somebody else to be the change

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,010
don't wait for somebody else to make stuff happen and when I was young I kind of thought that that meant

17
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,930
that you know you had to go out there and start changing the world and changing how people do things

18
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,280
and changing other stuff.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,810
But now that I've gotten older I've realized that be the change means like no manifest the change in

20
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,900
yourself first and then worry about everything else because as we each individually improve our own

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,470
lives the world is getting better by that amount.

22
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,300
And so I just commend you and that's why I think of education as the noblest of endeavors.

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:47,120
I commend you for improving your own life because if everybody in the world embarked on the journey

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,790
that you are embarking on right now the noblest of all endeavors that endeavor of educating yourself

25
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:59,000
of improving your life of building your skill set of becoming better and more knowledgeable so you can

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,030
contribute and help others and generate more income.

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,720
And with that extra income provide for yourself and provide for your family.

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,130
And if your wealth gets big enough you know influence and help others as you improve your own life as

29
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:19,570
you educate yourself as you come out of the darkness of ignorance the source of all suffering.

30
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:19,900
Right.

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,090
Because when people act on skillfully it's because they're ignorant they don't have the knowledge that

32
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,380
they need to act in a different way as you come out of the darkness of ignorance.

33
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,440
And that's the root of suffering as you come out of that and come into the light come into the light

34
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:44,960
of knowledge and knowing and awareness and better skills the doors the opportunities the the potential

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,290
of your life starts to fully open.

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,250
And so this can be a long process.

37
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,020
Life is both long and short.

38
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,750
It's both long and short.

39
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,650
And when you're young sometimes it can seem like man it's going to take forever to get where I want

40
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,100
to go I can't believe it.

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,890
This is such a big mountain to climb.

42
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,790
What else are you going to do with your time.

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,470
Right.

44
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,680
Like what else are you going to do with your time.

45
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,280
You to watch TV.

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,080
That's not a good use of your time a little bit.

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,470
OK.

48
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,810
Like you know have a little bit of fun relax a little bit.

49
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,510
But like there's stuff that you can know in life to live a better life.

50
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,580
I've created an entire course on that.

51
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,560
That course is called The Journey.

52
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,780
It's the things that I've learned in my life about how to live a better life.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,650
For instance focusing on the four areas of health your physical health your financial health your social

54
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,800
family health your psychological emotional health the four areas of health keeping those all in balance.

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,840
So you're you know not out of balance right because who wants to be that rich person on their deathbed.

56
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,420
Would all they have is money and nobody likes.

57
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:49,870
Right.

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,650
You've got to have social family health.

59
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,940
You've got to have physical health.

60
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,410
You've got to have financial help.

61
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,100
Unfortunately our world is a caste system based upon how much money you have.

62
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,670
And if you don't have money you don't get as good of food.

63
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,090
You don't get as good of living conditions.

64
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,810
Yes you don't get to live in the safer neighborhoods.

65
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,280
You don't get to drive to safer cars.

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,030
You don't get better.

67
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,180
You don't get as good of health care so as you build your skill set as you come out of the darkness

68
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,270
of ignorance the source of all suffering and as you move into the light of knowledge and knowing and

69
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:25,000
better skills you're improving the world one person at a time.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,530
And so that's the noblest of all endeavors.

71
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,350
And I just want to commend you.

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,690
Yes.

73
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,790
I get a man.

74
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,360
How little your brother.

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,850
Hallelujah sister I just want to commend you.

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,170
And by the way I come from my mom's side of the family a southern Pentecostal preacher.

77
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,920
So if I start preaching the good word a program and an education that's that's what you got coming for

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,200
you every now.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,320
Every now and then I get up on the pulpit and I also believe in humanity in sharing one's humanity and

80
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,500
in building software for humans right.

81
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,470
Knowing the humanity knowing humans and and what the tools are that they need the better we know humans

82
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,480
the better we recognize our own humanity and the humanity of others the better we're gonna be able to

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:18,980
build software for people and the more successful working b not only you know with the the products

84
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,550
the software that we build but also in our relationships.

85
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,810
So humanity is really important and being authentic and being a man of my word or a woman of my word

86
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,380
and saying what you mean and wearing your heart on your sleeve and having integrity so all that stuff

87
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,350
super important and.

88
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,790
But the main point of this video is I commend you for the step you're taken to improve your own life.

89
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:50,450
To start out on this in this journey and to embark upon the noblest of all endeavors and to educate

90
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,460
yourself come out of the darkness of ignorance and move into the light of awareness and knowing and

91
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,000
skills better skills that's only going to make the world better.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,170
So I'm going to speak to a little bit I said man when you're young it seemed like a huge hill to climb.

93
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,210
I'm going to speak to that coming up in a video.

94
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,250
I'm going to give you some skills to help you learn more effectively and to understand research backed

95
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,450
people right.

96
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:23,290
It's backed based on primarily the research you know or most most notably most notably the research

97
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,960
of Angela Duckworth on what makes students successful so as your teacher as your professor I'm in your

98
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,470
corner.

99
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,900
I want to see you succeed as a student so I'm going to I'm going to share with you what it takes to

100
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,510
succeed as a student so that you know that.

101
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,930
So you'll be like Okay that's what it takes to succeed.

102
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,880
I can do that if you don't know what you're doing right.

103
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,070
Education is kind of crazy or school systems crazy because you go there to learn but they never teach

104
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,760
you how to learn.

105
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,030
It's like you came there to learn but they never stop to show you how learn they just say start learning

106
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,450
this stuff.

107
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,410
There's a way you can learn better and if you know that you can apply and it's simple and it's easy

108
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,750
and I'm going to teach it to you and that's coming up.

109
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,630
So if you feel like me this is a big hill to climb I feel a little bit overwhelmed.

110
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,900
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get to the top of that mountain.

111
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,440
Go to that mountaintop where you could see the other side.

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,060
I don't know if I'm going to be able to get there.

113
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,010
We're gonna speak to that and tell you how to get there and I'm going to give you a little bit of inspiration

114
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,360
a little bit of wisdom.

115
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,430
I believe in something I like to think of as the education hierarchy.

116
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,320
So not only teach in skills and knowledge right.

117
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:32,050
Which is pretty much what most education today does a mediocre job of doing.

118
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,940
Not only giving you skills and knowledge but also giving you wisdom motivation inspiration to me.

119
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,520
That's the full monty.

120
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,190
That's the full kit.

121
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,500
Right.

122
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:50,200
You got skills knowledge wisdom motivation inspiration because I believe fundamentally at the root my

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,630
job isn't to just give you skills and knowledge.

124
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:59,170
My job is to motivate you and inspire you and teach you how to be the champion of your own life how

125
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:05,440
to get in the driver's seat of your own life how to be proactive how to have an internal locus of control.

126
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,700
One of the number one things they try to teach United States Marines when you become a United States

127
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:16,120
Marine they try to teach you how to and how to have an internal locus of control how to get in the driver's

128
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,020
seat of your own life how to be proactive how to build the life you want.

129
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,490
It ain't always easy right.

130
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,370
So that's one of the primary things I want to convey to you.

131
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,160
Knowledge skills and knowledge but also wisdom motivation inspiration Plutarch Plutarch says that the

132
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,250
mind is not a vessel to be filled.

133
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,050
The mind is not a vessel to be filled but Kindle to be ignited.

134
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,750
So that's one of the things I want to convey in this course.

135
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,240
I want to ignite the Kindle within you ignite the passion within you ignite the potential within you

136
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,580
so that you could build your best life improve the world one person at times starting with you you're

137
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,970
being the change and then realized great success and then go on out into the world and and share that

138
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:04,690
wisdom that knowledge spread the light of knowledge and skills to others so that so that the world becomes

139
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,540
better because there's a lot of ignorance out there a lot of suffering.

140
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,170
And education is the antidote when we learn we become more skillful when we become more skillful we

141
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,880
can build better things take better actions have a better life.

142
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,120
So that's what's common in this course.

143
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,090
I'm going to leave you with one last thing which is this quote by Omar Bradley since we were just talking

144
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,360
about the importance of knowledge skills and knowledge but also wisdom motivation and inspiration.

145
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:40,390
Omar Bradley who is a four star general five star general and war two man saw some action saw some darkness

146
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,980
and and there's this quote he has let me find it.

147
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,880
Let me try this one I'm not seeing it.

148
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,920
This guy is this guy is what do you call it somebody you look up to.

149
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,210
Right.

150
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,920
He's one of those people for me.

151
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,780
The words eluded me I'm a little bit under slaps a short term memory is gone out the window.

152
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,320
But here's Omar Bradley.

153
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,720
He's not a mentor.

154
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,040
I don't know him but not an idol.

155
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,330
I don't know what the word is man.

156
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,810
Message me on Twitter if you know what word I'm trying to come up with.

157
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,090
The world has achieved brilliance without conscience.

158
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,420
Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants.

159
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,950
We know more about war than we know about peace more about killing than we know about live.

160
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,920
If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence our servant may prove to be our

161
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,420
executioner.

162
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,990
So we are the Jedi Knight.

163
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,680
We are the humans with superpowers being able to code.

164
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:46,480
We are building the future and understanding the myth of Prometheus and how tech is a tool like buyers

165
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,880
a tool and it can be used for good or for bad and bring some wisdom right.

166
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,340
Similarly skills knowledge but wisdom motivation inspiration bringing some wisdom to that.

167
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,850
So you know in some ethical awareness about how do we use our tools.

168
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,740
I think that's all really important.

169
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,470
So that's the introduction of the course.

170
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:13,900
The primary takeaway my dear friend my fellow colleague on this planet my fellow human we are all in

171
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,220
this together to get a little California hippie on you right.

172
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,840
Yes we have to like take care of yourself first you gotta take care of yourself first gotta make your

173
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,030
own bed first feed yourself first.

174
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:25,410
Right.

175
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,070
But once you get your own house in order you can step out and start helping other people were all in

176
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,850
it together.

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,980
And I just want to convey this at the beginning the course and the primary takeaway is I commend you

178
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,070
for embarking on this journey.

179
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,210
I commend you for embarking on this journey and that's a 100 percent heartfelt and I'm 100 percent in

180
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:50,470
your corner and I wish for you as strongly as I wish for anybody in the world including my own children.

181
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,600
Your your success.

182
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,890
I want to see you succeed.

183
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,390
I want to see you triumph.

184
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,790
I want to see you realize the life you want.

185
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,010
And so whatever that means for you a life of goodness where you're helping others.

186
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,500
That's that's what it's all about.

187
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,620
So I got a lot of good stuff to share in this course.

188
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,880
We're going to be focused primarily on technology but the human element is important as software engineers

189
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,960
we're going to talk about that in its own video coming out because the more we understand humans the

190
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,680
better the products and service we're going to be able to build the better the relationships we're gonna

191
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,760
be able to build the better life we're gonna be able to build.

192
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,240
So welcome to class.

193
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm glad you're here.

194
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,300
Super glad you're here.

195
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,940
I commend you for taking this first step.

196
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,860
