1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,520
OK so now we have a video dedicated specifically to this concept of being built for humans.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,130
I think this is an important concept to remember and it's a concept that I'm remembering we've already

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,270
spoken to a couple of times already.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,160
But it's also a concept.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,140
So not only for me building this class is something that's important for me to remember but also as

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,330
you're building any software.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,640
Generally speaking all software eventually is being built for humans.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,300
Right.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,770
So thinking about that just thinking about how can I more effectively build this for humans.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,330
I think that's an important perspective to bring to this creative process of software engineering where

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,100
we build better tools for humans.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,500
And so I just wanted to speak to that in its own video.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,510
And I'm going to share with you something.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,910
It's a acronym and that acronym is CSI computer science right.

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:01,030
Normally we think of CSI as computer science CSI and you could see that right here in the course outline

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,980
CSI.

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:08,140
But for me I was thinking about this the other day and and I realized in the phrase that came to me

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:16,540
as an alternate meaning for CSI is collectively stupid collectively intelligent right collectively stupid

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:24,010
collectively intelligent because there is this thing called multiple intelligences and so multiple intelligences

20
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:30,340
means that you know I might know some stuff about X but not Y and you might know a lot about y but not

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,240
much about X. And so we all have multiple intelligences so collectively you know each of us individually

22
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,580
right has areas that we don't know stuff and together we individually we have areas where we do know

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,110
stuff.

24
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,880
So together we're more intelligent and then collectively stupid doesn't quite fit as much.

25
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:54,580
But there is group think where a bunch of humans can make bad decisions together and history is littered

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,440
with examples of that.

27
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,310
Right.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,610
So you don't have to look very hard maybe even at the place where you work to see a group of people

29
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,180
making bad decisions.

30
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:12,820
And so just remembering that you are a representative of this great profession and this great domain

31
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:18,790
called Computer Science CSI and not only does CSI stand for computer science but also collectively stupid

32
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,730
and collectively intelligence and sometimes groups of people can make really bad decisions.

33
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:32,740
So it behooves us and it's part it's it's bestowed upon us it's part of our responsibility to speak

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,620
up when we think a group of people are making a bad decision and then also to recognize that collectively

35
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,400
we are also more intelligent that we can all work together both sides of the same coin.

36
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:43,840
All right.

37
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,800
Because we all know certain things and don't know other things.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,680
And so I wanted to speak to this at the beginning this course because this course is going to have two

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,490
instructors and I will be one of the instructors and then my friend my colleague a former student of

40
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:06,240
mine Daniel is going to be the other instructor and we're going to teach this course together.

41
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,380
And the reason we're teaching it together is because there's things I do not know I am a great I'm a

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:18,280
great introductory introductory Comp Sci professor I'm very good at teaching introductory classes that's

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,090
what I've done for a large part of my career but I've been on kind of like a loop cycle since my academic

44
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,230
training was in economics and business I've been on it kind of recursive for loop where I just teach

45
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,200
the intro classes and so you know if you don't have industry experience if you aren't using it in the

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,410
trenches every day there's a lot that's lost.

47
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,270
Can I teach the intro classes great.

48
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,060
Yes.

49
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,370
Right.

50
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:51,970
I have that down but all of the nuances that you get when you're a professional developer that from

51
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,340
using it six seven eight hours a day you don't get that when you're professor is a professor teaching

52
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,370
intro classes going to committees grading stuff meeting with students and helping them.

53
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:11,380
And so we're gonna have Daniel in here and I'm going to model for you what it means to collaborate to

54
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,380
work with other people to be humble and to say man I don't know anything about that and to ask questions

55
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,870
because we're going to go into stuff in which into which I do not have knowledge.

56
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,790
And so you know I have some cursory understanding but Daniel will have the expertise in that area and

57
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,880
so we're gonna be exploring that territory together.

58
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,110
I'll be able to ask astute questions I'll be able to slow things down if they start going too fast.

59
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,600
If like Daniel's like firing way I could like wait a minute wait a minute let's break that down let's

60
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,230
pull that apart and look at all that in one video and really get that concept.

61
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,770
And so that's what we're gonna be doing and there'll be two teachers and I'll be one of them and there's

62
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,250
things I know and there's things I don't know.

63
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,520
So part of this course will be going into territory or things I don't know which is great because I'm

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,540
excited to do this course so that I can learn but somebody who's a professional dad and who's working

65
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,980
and using it every day in the trenches because I want to broaden my skill set and so that's a really

66
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,260
important human trait to bring into your life to be humble to be willing to learn.

67
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,570
I don't understand why any how anybody could be a teacher if they aren't also willing to learn which

68
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,530
means being willing to say I don't know.

69
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,780
Which means being willing to be humble.

70
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,210
And so many teachers feel like they have to be the expert and have all the answers.

71
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,570
My goal as a teacher is to get it clear and to get it clearly conveyed to you right.

72
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,900
So I can understand it and I could convey that understanding to you and we could do that together.

73
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,060
That's my goal and I have to learn to do that.

74
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,650
And so we're going to be going through this course together in that way.

75
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,450
And one of my previous courses I shared this phrase that came to me when I started thinking about making

76
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:56,820
this video and this phrase is that the more I admit I do not know the higher I go the higher I go the

77
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,450
harder it becomes to admit I do not know.

78
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,980
I know it's a little bit like some kind of Zen paradox or something but here it is right there so you

79
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,850
can read it.

80
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,940
The more I admit I do not know the higher I go the higher I go the harder it becomes to admit I do not

81
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,270
know.

82
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:20,940
So holding on to that that that reality right that not everybody knows everything that we all have areas

83
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,220
where we know stuff we have areas where we don't know stuff holding onto that reality and being willing

84
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:34,800
to own it and embrace it because everybody tries to like put up a front and you know a few skate and

85
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,260
you know present themselves more powerful or knowledgeable or better than they are it's like just be

86
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,320
who you are.

87
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,930
And so you know being willing to admit like oh I don't know anything about that please tell me more.

88
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,600
So when I was a graduate student I remember being in a class and asking a question and the professors

89
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,340
like would and answered it and then he's like do you get it.

90
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,650
And I'm like I still don't get it.

91
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,660
Professor tried to explain it again.

92
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,560
He said Do you get ice.

93
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,970
I still don't get it.

94
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,540
And you said come see me during office hours.

95
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,890
I said OK right.

96
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,150
And and then after class one of the students came out to me is like and was like I'm so glad you're

97
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,130
asking questions because I didn't get it either I'm like Why didn't you speak up you know.

98
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,110
But you know it's like people are afraid to admit like it's a sign of weakness that they don't know

99
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,620
something.

100
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,650
So anyhow it's important to meet you don't know it's him.

101
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,410
That's the first step in learning.

102
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,660
And through this course it'll be taught by myself and my colleague and friend Daniel and former student

103
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,590
and a professional working Deb and so I'll be learning here alongside with him.

104
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,640
So that's how the course is going to be structured.

105
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,940
All right.

106
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,910
So that's that's a built for humans this course is built for humans it's built for humans.

107
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:51,900
Built for you it's built for me and part of our humanity is you know that idea of multiple intelligences

108
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,360
we all know stuff we all also don't know stuff and being willing to be humble and collaborate with others

109
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,830
and work with others and to learn.
