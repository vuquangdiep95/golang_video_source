1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,170
Now let's talk about my credentials so my credentials are that I'm a tenured professor in California.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,470
I've taught at the University and the college level for over 20 years.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,270
I started teaching as an adjunct professor in 1997 and I was one of the first university professors

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,290
to teach online.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,740
I taught online in nineteen ninety seven.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,370
It's hard to believe I haven't made a ton of money off the Internet.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:33,540
I didn't create some dot.com startup and partly that's because my background is in economics an undergraduate

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,300
degree in economics and a master's in business after teaching adjunct faculty as an adjunct faculty

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,220
at the University for three years.

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,240
In 2000 a tenured position at the Community College opened up and I went to work at the college teaching

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,120
accounting in 2001.

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,250
In 2001 they needed somebody to teach programming because this was right after the dot.com boom Internet.

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,750
Well the Internet's been going since the 60s but the World Wide Web it just like kind of gone through

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,180
its dot.com boom and crash but is like they needed programming professors and they said Are you willing

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,010
to teach that I was good with computers so I started teaching web dev teaching myself and teaching students

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,060
web dev.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,250
I've since taught web death to undergraduates and graduate students in computer science at both the

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,090
college and university only at the University of graduate students in computer science and then two

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,110
thousand and five.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,250
I was continuing to do postgraduate work and online education at UC San Diego always improving myself

21
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,730
always bettering myself always looking to see like how can I learn and grow and become a better person.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,130
Right.

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,330
So I was doing postgraduate work in online education at UC San Diego and then about 2005 I started with

24
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,430
a calling something called the online teacher training program where we taught all of the college faculty

25
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,080
in central California how to teach online.

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:04,350
In 2008 I was recognized as one of the top professors in the entire California system which is the largest

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,120
post secondary system in America with over 2 million students I was one of the top eight or 10 or 12.

28
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:18,780
I forget how many there were professors recognized in 2008 and 2013 I learned about the Go programming

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,420
language and I learned that Google looked at all the other languages and said none of them are meeting

30
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:24,870
our needs.

31
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,490
We've got to create a new one and then they tasked Rob Pike Ken Thompson Robert Grossman to build it.

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,850
And so those are those are three individuals who are luminaries in computer science heavy hitters.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,150
They helped build the C programming language the Unix operating system and you TFA encoding coding scheme

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,740
and so they built to basically help build the bedrock of computer science.

35
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,680
They said We're gonna build a new language and they did it with Google.

36
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,950
I said I'm going to know that language.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,610
So I started learning that language in 2013 that I was one of the first university professors in America

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,170
to teach go at the University level.

39
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,650
And and I've also created online go courses which is one of these courses right here.

40
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,670
So it's a little bit about my credentials and my background.

41
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,490
I have an ability to teach right.

42
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,460
I've learned that over two decades.

43
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,500
Malcolm Gladwell takes 10000 hours to get good at something I've been doing this right.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,840
That's about 10 years.

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,540
I've been doing this twice that long.

46
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:28,980
So the ability to teach and create online classes and I understand computer science and programming

47
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,250
but I'm not the high end computer science professor I've done introductory classes because my training

48
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,060
hasn't been in computer science.

49
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,900
So that's a little bit about my background.

50
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,300
I'm just looking here to see if there's anything else that you know I wanted to include in here.

51
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,900
And I think it's good for you to know a little bit about your teachers background just so you can kind

52
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,080
of see how the life journey that I took and where I ended up.

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,900
And I love programming and to add this into I love programming because I love building and I love creating.

54
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,290
And for me building and creating and making something and bringing it into the world is one of the most

55
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,500
satisfying things ever.

56
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,160
And so all of the different endeavors I've been involved with in my life and I started out in high school

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,740
I loved making documentaries and I was nationally recognized as a high school student for making documentaries

58
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:24,630
and I went to UCLA before declaring my major in economics and I and I wanted to study film and television

59
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:33,590
and had some life struggles super socially challenged when I was young and I like almost like retarded.

60
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,850
So socially challenged.

61
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,590
And so anyhow that's my undergraduate degree.

62
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,600
I ended up getting it in economics.

63
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,500
I started out in film and television.

64
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,450
I've had a love of literature and the humanities in my life.

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,550
But this theme of building and creating whether it's documentaries or all those read books over there

66
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:57,840
those are all books I've written during a hard time in my life whereas that basically ground zero and

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,580
I don't think I could have gone any lower without dying.

68
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,380
I built myself back up from that and part of that was writing my way out and just had to experience

69
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,360
so much loss in my life and I had so much grief at one point in my life.

70
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,730
That is all I could do.

71
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,690
Like at one point I was walking on the campus of college campus and a colleague said Hey Todd how are

72
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,150
you doing.

73
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,390
I just stark.

74
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,020
You know and because I'd just gone through a huge loss and I had so much grief and so that's how I got

75
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,850
out of it.

76
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,360
So those books I like them you know and I'll just share a little bit.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,100
You could publish some of my wrote about 50 novels so I teach during the day and I just go home at night

78
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,780
and I'd write and I'd write and I'd write I wrote about a book a month for a couple of years.

79
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,720
I wrote 50 books and I published about 20 of them.

80
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,280
And so one of them here this is about Hitler if he had been reincarnated.

81
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,830
That's the surprise ending.

82
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,750
But once and then again.

83
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,890
So the ideal vice which the German shoulders soldiers would climb up the mountain to get pinned into

84
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,820
their lapel.

85
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,760
So this theme of humanity.

86
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:09,640
And if you look at TAC in the history of tech and if you look at like the wars right.

87
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:17,840
Steve was me AK and if you look at like Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak Steve Jobs dude I can't believe I'm.

88
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,970
Yes he was an actor both named Steve.

89
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:27,850
And if you look at likes Steve Jobs and like they were all people who are really interested in art and

90
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:36,190
humanity and like was the Woz ended up sponsoring the ballet with some of his riches and and Steve Jobs

91
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,570
was like you know really into different cultures and different religions and went over to India and

92
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:46,300
studied meditation for a while and was really into calligraphy which is why early computers had all

93
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,150
these different beautiful fonts that you could use.

94
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,740
And so this idea of like creation and you know like you know software engineering is very much engineering.

95
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:02,210
But there's also this idea of building things for humans and and having that be a part of it.

96
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,650
And so I share all that so you have a little bit of information about my credentials and where I'm coming

97
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:14,790
from and what I know and what my experience has been and my perspective and also yeah.

98
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,400
So you just know a little bit about me.

99
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,370
So I think it's good for you to know a little bit about your teacher before you get into the class because

100
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,790
actually a lot of research on learning theory says that the more that you feel some pot to go with your

101
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,140
teacher the more you have a connection with your teacher the better you do in the class.

102
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,940
And we all know this from personal experience right like if you hate your teacher you don't even want

103
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,220
to go to the class.

104
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,850
And if you like your teacher you like I'm you can go to that class and start remember when I was an

105
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:48,820
undergraduate I had a calculus professor and I only had to take one calculus class but I liked this

106
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,650
guy so much I called him the Monk of mathematics.

107
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,700
I liked him so much I took two more calculus classes I guess maybe two more calculus classes.

108
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,710
And so I took three classes when I only needed one because I just when this guy would go to the whiteboard

109
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:08,290
and do math is like watching Michelangelo like paint and you know like maybe I speculate what that might

110
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,970
is just like you got this peaceful for you they just stand back and look at what he wrote on the board

111
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,050
and admire it.

112
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:20,510
And it's like I just loved seeing his love for his craft and that kept me in the class.

113
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,970
So we we don't go to classes where we don't like the professor and you know we we do better in classes

114
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,140
where we do like the professors.

115
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,610
That's why I share a little bit this humanity.

116
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,820
And and I also just really want to convey that concept of you know we're building things for humans

117
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,250
we've got to know humans we've got to understand humanity and I love building stuff whether it's writing

118
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:47,350
a novel or creating a documentary or building a website or creating a course like all of that's joy

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,590
joy for me.

120
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,340
So those those that's a little bit about my credentials.

121
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,120
Yeah.
