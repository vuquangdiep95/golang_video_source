1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,820
Say you got some package that's using some other package like say here I've got I've just created a

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:14,000
simple may not go it imports are a go goes to heaven going projects going all the way down to zero zero

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,450
three go modules zero for upgrade energy dependency and I'm just using that.

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:18,940
Hello.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,390
Hello.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:31,620
To make this work because this particular folder is package hello it's like you to load up hello do

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,290
you call this function.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,380
Yeah it's package Hello Function Hello yeah.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:43,960
So if I in that and this is a go module so if I go run mean dot go.

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,880
Yeah I think it is say I didn't see it in there.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:57,130
No I gotta go back out and see it's over to replace so go run main go so it will stay I'll start finding

12
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:04,060
that package so it prints hello world and you can see there's the Reporter Where's your main go where's

13
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,750
that same.

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,200
No this is any this is not in going OK it's somewhere else.

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,930
Yeah I got somewhere else with it's own go mod which is now which is requiring the ghost eleven one

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,330
indirectly so which is God.

17
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:24,500
So that just pulled it off of the Mir Yeah it's or we could probably probably.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,560
Yeah probably added to the Mir site probably actually it put in it got the zipped version zero stuff

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,170
so I might actually want to run go get on that to see about.

20
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,060
Nope it's still looking at the latest version I'm not I'm wondering why it's like going to calling it

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:54,410
v 0 1 0 if you go get the 0 1 0 with it do it good try the 0 1 0 finding

22
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,960
did we push me 0 1 0 yes it's it's here Oh yeah.

23
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,300
There it is Delanie extracting it is nice.

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:17,780
All right so now we're using the D 0 1 0 of this thing and so you run it go run may not go and go oh

25
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,560
I really don't like having a comma or a period there or there's a bug in the function or something you

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,320
need to fix it but it's going to take too long for the original owner to fix it so you go OK I'm going

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,920
to fix it myself so you fork the repo

28
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:48,810
which takes however long to fork just a few seconds yeah yeah yeah it's done and so you can clone this

29
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,910
so I'll just go back out I got to go back out and get a quote here

30
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,770
um do I actually have just testing real fast.

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:13,020
Yes that is a quick shortcut to open up my editor to this location so now I decide ok well I want this

32
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,140
to not have the period where the comma so let's fix this I just want to say hello world when I type

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:28,260
when to call that Hello Function and then presumably at this point you would get you'd add that you'd

34
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,600
get commit this

35
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,110
better wording on

36
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,870
function and oh you would also want to update here to make sure your tests still work

37
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:06,090
so make sure that everything still works in this project um because this is an 0 0 3 0 4 Go test.

38
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,920
Make sure it's the test still works because you're fixing something you've already added you need to

39
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,310
add again.

40
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,590
Yeah.

41
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,230
Yep.

42
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,410
So for that.

43
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:21,300
So now fix her remove punk shoe Asian from low.

44
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:29,710
Shen And I push this to your foot to my fork which is not affect fact the original repo

45
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,740
so that my fork says it's one commit ahead.

46
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,200
So presumably at this point you'd create a pull request as well.

47
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,670
But in the meantime going back to your original project

48
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:54,620
you still need to figure out you still need to make sure this particular you fix the punctuation here.

49
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:01,250
Now one thing you could do is you could adjust this import.

50
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:09,770
I could change this to a lower dose and this would work but that's not really viable if you got a really

51
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:18,110
large project where you got the import everywhere and so modules has a way to basically alias it an

52
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:27,270
import to some other module and so you can find this out by looking for go help mod a C there's a edit

53
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:37,110
an edit command for go mod Edit So I you go help mod edit you will find all the information on the edit

54
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:46,820
command including a new a comma a dash replace so you can use this dash replace to replace an old to

55
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:59,140
a new so if you do go mod edit dash replace and the old is the old module with this module not the whole

56
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:10,590
package old module is going to be replaced with a dot com slash or dose slash going project which is

57
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,580
my fork.

58
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,870
So this this will be replaced with that

59
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:29,340
um UN version to a new path must be local directory so at m..

60
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:36,780
So now if I look in here and if I I my import still says goes to eleven but if I go into the go mod

61
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:44,980
I now has it still says requires goes to eleven going project but now there's also a replace goes to

62
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:53,740
eleven with or alerts going project and if I test this go run main I go it'll now start looking.

63
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,150
It doesn't it doesn't have my word it's going project for so now it's nice to go find it and download

64
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,270
it

65
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,240
that's pretty cool yeah says hello world without the comma in the period.

66
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,410
That's pretty cool.

67
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,930
And so when you would then you'd also have your poorer class and whenever the original person merges

68
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:20,730
your poor request you can then just go into your go module and delete the replace line would you have

69
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,300
to take it was it did it get set in an environment variable.

70
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,900
No it's just this replacement.

71
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,260
Okay.

72
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,130
It's very nice.

73
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,300
Well done.

74
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,170
Higher level stuff.

75
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,210
Let's get to know about C..

76
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,750
This should be rare but every once in a while some package has a bug and you can figure out how to fix

77
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,230
it in 10 minutes but it's going to take a day take a week for the pull request to be accepted.

78
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,200
So this will let you keep working while that happens.

79
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,910
Nicely done.
