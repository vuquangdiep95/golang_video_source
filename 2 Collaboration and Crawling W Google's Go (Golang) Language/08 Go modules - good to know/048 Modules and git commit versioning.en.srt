1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,810
So now we're going to take a look at modules and get comment versioning and then we're going to look

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,390
at get forks and module path replacement and then we're going to do review commands and kind of review

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,500
everything we've learned so far.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,160
And Daniel's got some information here to share with us about modules and get commit versioning.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,580
I'm looking forward to learning it myself and see what it is.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,350
So.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,410
So you may wonder if you have seen the this releases page on on github for RC quote and all the other

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,620
get all the other modules will have releases as well with version numbers.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:46,780
How do you do for your own project by go to this going project and look because your releases so to

10
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,360
do it is it's following get tax so which is just a part of kit itself.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,870
So if I do get tagged they'll say we've got no tax on our system.

12
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,380
So let me make just make sure real fast.

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,230
I am on the master branch.

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm up to date so to create a tag is actually very simple.

15
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,860
It's simply get tag and the tag name.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:16,480
So what we've got so far here is what a get tag is just something you're tagging your a particular commit

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,740
to this particular amount.

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,090
OK.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,350
Yeah.

20
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:18,670
So.

21
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,190
So get tagged just lets you tag a particular commit with basically a name that can be used for in the

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:32,000
future so to create a get tag it's just get tag and then the name of the tag.

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,940
So for going modules your tags should follow the semantic versioning.

24
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:45,790
So for this case we could say this is this particular commit here with the go modules example for complete

25
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:53,260
we can call this version zero point 1.0 nice.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,480
So that creates the get tags now and you get tag it's there.

27
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,830
However I can not able to push it by default with just to get push it does not work.

28
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:11,780
Well you have to do instead is you can either use get push origin and then the tag name.

29
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,950
Zero point one point.

30
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:21,860
So this would work for pushing up a specific tag Alternately you can get push dash dash tags to push

31
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:31,960
all tags so which is what I will do here.

32
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:40,280
So now you can see it says new tag v 1 0 1 0 is pushed and if I go back to the Hub page and a refresh

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,360
the page it now says there is one release if I click that I can now see the version is now available

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,430
version tag so I'm making little notes here of the commands and the first clan you can see is create

35
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,470
a tag and we get tag tag name and then we have show to show a tag for whatever the current tag you gave

36
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:01,750
is.

37
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:09,870
So get tags shows a list of all the tags can get brown tail branches show a list of all the tags and

38
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,720
let's just get tagging them to push a tag we can do get push origin and tag name or we can do get pushed

39
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,580
dest hash tag is all right.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,050
Really.

41
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,470
Yes.

42
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,850
This is dash hashtag.

43
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,550
Yes.

44
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,600
All right good.

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,190
Any other command dash dash tags with net tags within that.

46
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,270
And.

47
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,500
And so anytime we're ready to go to a major minor patch we just add that tag and then that tag starts

48
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,030
there that tag it's now attached to whatever committee you are currently on.

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,830
So make sure you're on the right branch that's awesome.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,900
And and if there things that we are committing at the same time we would do all of that with get push.

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,690
Dash dash tags because they'll do the push and then also include the tags the tags it says all tag bring

52
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,430
it on all text you have to list amount with the get push origin technique Excellent.

53
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,730
So that's a modules and get commit versioning and then this this allows us to start adding versions

54
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:12,330
to our module so that other people would be able to then using modules import one of our versions or

55
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,150
the latest version as opposed to just the random commit.

56
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,030
That was the least that point in time.

57
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,280
Do you have anything you want to add to this.

58
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:20,640
No.
