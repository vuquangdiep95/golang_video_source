1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:09,830
One question I have is if that works for a minor or a patch and we want to go Major we got to add that

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,430
new V.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,270
How do we do that.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,080
When you go doing a major update it's you tag it still.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,220
But you also have to go into your go mod and add in your v into the Go on.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,100
Because this is your namespace C gets spit specifying your go mod as well.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:33,720
So before you get hub dot.com or Florida's replays like where's our mod for this project.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,800
So for good modules there.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,860
And so this one is just going project.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,420
We are ready for v 2 we would add V to there we'd add V to there we go into all of the files that would

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,820
if we had a file that imported some other package it's also in this module we would need to update that

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,400
to be the V to import as well.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,020
So if we had an import of our packet that comes and goes

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,090
smell too.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:13,660
I've been doing checked slash dot com in slash comment or something and now B we would now need to add

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,410
in a v2.

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,490
OK so so you'd have to update all your own imports and then you have to update your your good months

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,590
and namespace and so that doesn't refer to folder.

19
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,480
So it's not like we need to take everything there was in version 1 and put it in the V 1 folder and

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,080
take everything we want in version to copy all that put into two folder.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,900
Now the V1 V2 is not talking about those folder.

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,990
No it's it's the name it's part of the namespace.

23
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,200
OK.

24
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,890
Call.

25
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,550
All right.

26
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:43,990
Thanks.
