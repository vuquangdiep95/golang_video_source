1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,700
So now we're going to take a look at just sort of review some of the commands that we've seen through

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,620
this section and then we're going to move into some hands on exercises and I'm looking forward to those

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,470
hands on exercises because I love working the challenges and problems in myself but the commands that

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,970
we've gone through so far as go mod a net and so go modern that is how you create a go module and you

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,430
want to do that in your root directory your read directories if you're working on it or if you're using

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,920
get it's going to be where you're hit and get folder is empty the directory from which all the other

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,930
directories in your project merge or transcend or originate from or under the tree structure.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
So go modern IT CREATES A go module.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,840
Do you have anything more to say about go modern.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,020
It also gives you your go mod file.

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,340
Yep.

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:51,600
Yeah.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:51,940
Come on.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,620
And it creates them on file.

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,620
You have to name the namespace yourself unless it can figure it out based.

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:04,000
Because if you're on your go to have that to figure it out so add your namespace to that by example

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,860
dot com forward slash hello or get hub dot com forward slash user name goes to Levin forward slash repo

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,960
name so whatever your namespace is if you're on your go path already it'll figure out the namespace

19
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,720
path.

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,750
So you it in that case but under most circumstances you'll need to put that there and then go build

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,620
and go test another package building commands add new dependencies to go mod as needed and and then

22
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:35,380
we can see what's in go mod by opening it up or carrying it or we can list all of the current modules

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,400
dependencies.

24
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,830
Those would be direct and indirect dependencies.

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,460
So we've learned what that is.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,920
And we've really learned quite a bit going through all this about package management direct tendencies

27
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:55,780
and indirect dependencies and go modules and keeping track of which packages and specifying which packages

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:05,390
you could go get a package name and you can also add in an at you know with the version or latest.

29
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,480
So that's not being R but close.

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,570
So there's some examples down below where it says it so go get the package and they'll bring in the

31
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,050
latest.

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,350
You could add in ladies if you want or you could specify an exact version and then go mod tidy removes

33
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:28,390
any unused dependency dependencies and adds dependencies for other platforms as Daniel pointed out earlier

34
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,060
and then we have go doc package name where we can look at the documentation for package.

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,720
Anything you want to add to all those do we leave any thing out.

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,450
Only if you want to put in something about the the added the replace or the get tag yeah that's that's

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,370
so kind.

38
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,530
They're kind of fancy here.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Yeah.

40
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,360
That the added The get tag is import get tags important and it's fairly easy.

41
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,290
But yeah let's get into the replaces replace is is that advanced.

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,910
Yeah look it up when you need a good tag and then we have the tag name right.

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,830
Yeah.

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,960
And so those commands are all right there.

45
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,250
Create a tag Share list of tags I guess we'll just list each of those out right here.

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,720
That's good to happen down there.

47
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,550
So we have.

48
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,240
So we'll just put these under tag tags.

49
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,010
Let's do that.

50
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:27,200
Black tags and we'll have the commands right there because they're all related to the same deal and

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,130
we'll make those red.

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,150
I will make those red on my own time but that is.

53
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,040
Those are the commands we've learned through this.

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,680
I think it's for me handy to have all those commands there and just remind myself how everything we

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,330
learned it's really comes down to using these commands.

56
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,910
So all right.

57
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,520
Anything else.

58
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,260
We will see you in the next videos with hands on exercises.
