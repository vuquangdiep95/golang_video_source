1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,460
OK.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,310
So now we're going to do a little workflow summary so as workflow summary is a bit of a review and you're

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,170
going to kind of see everything we've just learned.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,360
Integrated together.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,910
And I'm gonna do that.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,380
And so going to my terminal.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,260
Like the first thing I want to do is just do a get pull and make sure that everything is current then

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,600
tells me I'm already up to date.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,160
I could see the working project that I'm in right there.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,730
And if I do get branch it's just going to show me my local branches.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,940
But if I do get branch dash a it's gonna show me all of my branches and let's say I have an idea f or

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,920
something I want to do I want to add a new file so I'm going to go work on a different branch and so

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,520
I'm gonna do a get check out dash B I'm going to create a new branch by checking it out.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,200
That's how you do it and then add the branch name.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,950
And this one is going to be I don't know what you're doing dogs.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,630
Maybe we should switch to birds.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,360
So this is we're going to add birds to our thing and so now if I do might get branch dash eight shows

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,900
me.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,710
There it is.

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,410
Get branch s eight shows me I'm on the bird branch and I could create a new file here so I'm going to

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,210
now parakeet that T T.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,120
And they sure don't know much about birds.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,640
I heard a really interesting that you show me that YouTube video of the bird of YouTube who's singing

24
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,190
the Imperial March from Star Wars is awesome.

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,670
Check it out.

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,900
You haven't seen it.

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,220
And.

28
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,980
And then I could do it get status and I could do.

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,110
I could see I've got a new file.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,850
Could you get add dash a get comment if I wanted to on it get add I could have added the file name and

31
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:44,630
adds parakeet file which describes one trait parakeets.

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,570
So having meaningful command messages it's important so trying to model that too.

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,190
And now if I do get status and now if I do get push it's going to ask me Hey do you want to send this

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,910
up to get a job and I'm like OK.

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,830
Yes sure.

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
If I didn't want to.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,920
Like if I'm working in a community with other developers I want to push my branches up to the remote

38
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,810
so that whoever's watching this project they all have eyes on who's doing what.

39
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,050
And so the people who are the collaborators on the project use the get up phrase who are watching the

40
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,690
game project they could see what the different branches are that are being worked on and and have an

41
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,340
idea of who's doing what.

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,170
Right.

43
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,410
And so some teams maybe would even have it would they have a practice of pre fixing a branch with the

44
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,540
developer's name you know that oh this developers working on this branch because otherwise you have

45
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,660
to do a little digging to figure out whose branch came from her.

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:44,040
So the most common way actually is to prefix it with an issue number so you can create issues which

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,330
are basically bug request bug reports or feature requests.

48
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,810
And the most common is to prefix your branch name with the net with the number of the issue on Github.

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,070
So it's associates at the branches associated and get hub actually knows about this and will actually

50
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,510
stick like links in the issue like this there's a branch for this issue over here.

51
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,790
That's super cool.

52
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,270
All right.

53
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,270
So now that I'm going to push this up I'm going to do the command that was offered to me here by.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,150
So I push that up and and then maybe I'll just get everything current again with the get pull but get

55
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,870
pull see if that brings anything down but if I go to get hub now I could look here and go to site click

56
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,810
on that it refreshes everything I could go to two branches and we've got birds as as the new branch

57
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,600
and master and.

58
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:41,430
And now if I wanted to merge this I could do a new poll request right here from get hub and in here

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,480
it automatically gives the name and I'd leave some comment I think I think we should include info about

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:58,950
birds or whatever and create pottery class and then since I'm a collaborator that pull requests I go

61
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,690
back to my project go Lang and then go look at the poll requests that all requests right here I click

62
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,560
on it and I could merge this poll request I think we should create that adds parakeet file if I want

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,340
to see the files changed I could go right there I could look at the different commits that have been

64
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,230
submitted in this poll request and then go back to the conversation I'd say this looks good or look

65
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:33,060
looks good to me LG T.M. and a comment and then merge request merge pull requests and confirm merge

66
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,380
and then I'm going to come back to my terminal and I'm going to do it get pull.

67
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,100
Get everything current.

68
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,940
And it tells me here from get hub.

69
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,690
And if I do get branch dash a tells me I'm on birds.

70
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,380
But I wanted to get check out.

71
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,860
And just I want to move to master not create a branch.

72
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,710
I'm just checking out M. not adding the dash B.

73
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,020
And now if I look at my branches I'm a master.

74
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,700
I want to get pull again what did I.

75
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,020
Yeah.

76
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,200
Just pointing out and show it tells you specifically you were Master your local master is behind the

77
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,070
origin master.

78
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,640
So you probably want to get pull.

79
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,910
Yes some men do get pull.

80
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,940
Get that car in again and.

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,070
And when I look at my branches that I'm there and then I'm gonna do to delete a branch I could come

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,420
over here back here and delete the branch from up here.

83
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,640
And and that's under branches.

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,800
And then delete birds.

85
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:32,110
And then I could do a get pull once more and then look at my branches and I could get to remove this

86
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,180
branch I could do get branch Dash.

87
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:47,750
D birds and get an origin go and now look at my branches and I've got masters and remote origin master

88
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,080
which is great.

89
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,150
So that was getting everything going and summarize that workflow right here.

90
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,790
So we create a branch get check out DSP branch name you could see your branches see all branches get

91
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:06,190
branch a you can work on a branch branch by get get check out branch name the switch to branch which

92
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,680
you use a name which newly created branches it automatically puts you in to call to check out still

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:18,600
see stars of the branch and stage files and then get stars and commit files and check out master and

94
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:27,330
you could merge from the terminal we did it from the get hub and you could push to your remote repo

95
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,720
you could delete your branch and then you could prune your origin.

96
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,070
So that's pretty good stuff.

97
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,900
Anything to add to that.

98
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,670
No.

99
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,210
The nice thing that I think one of the things that was also covered this video is prefixes.

100
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:48,580
Branches with with an issue number from get hub is a useful practice right.

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,170
Yeah.

102
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,510
So that was awesome at it all right.

103
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,840
That's a little workflow.

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,700
Get hub summary.
