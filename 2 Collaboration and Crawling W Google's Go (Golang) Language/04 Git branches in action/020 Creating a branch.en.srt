1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,130
So just to anchor you in the course outline we just got finished with working with merge requests.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,050
You could see what we've done here so far.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,940
We did a little introduction to Daniel and get we did understanding SS H encryption.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,550
We did creating our github repo and we also showed how to work in windows when we were doing that.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,570
And you know getting get bash terminal running on Windows we saw adding a collaborator to get how we

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,660
saw cloning a public project and cloning and forking kind of saw both of those.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,890
And then we looked a little bit about if everybody is working on Master how those could lead that could

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,370
lead to merge conflicts and how you deal with merge conflicts and then branches don't eliminate merge

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:49,890
conflicts but they help more people work together on the same project and it helps segment kind of what

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,910
is happening in where you can kind of see where people are working and what they're working on but merge

11
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,970
conflicts aren't eliminated by branches.

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,130
And so once they are pushed to the end of the branch that's that's not happening while you're working

13
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,200
and interrupting your work say Say that again goes away in the merge conflict when you're using branches

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,470
though merge conflicts are eliminated but they are all pushed to the end of the branch lifetime instead

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,330
of while you're working.

16
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,760
So if you're just doing that you're all working on master every time you commit there's potential for

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,240
merge conflict at that point.

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,690
I got it.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,620
Whereas if you're using branches it's only when you're done with the branch and you're merging the branch

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:35,440
back into the map where you merge the branches together at the end of your work you've you've made all

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,040
of your things you're going to make you've made all your changes you're done thinking about new stuff.

22
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,770
Now you change you can switch your train of thought to.

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,040
OK now what's the conflicts.

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:53,380
And just for all of us code heads out there all of us engineers branches and get doesn't eliminate the

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,410
need for communication between humans.

26
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:02,380
It's still also vitally important to communicate with your team and let people know what you're working

27
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:02,650
on.

28
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,740
So you could try to eliminate those conflicts as much as possible.

29
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,900
And so remember that.

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,630
So right now if I look to see what project I'm in I'm in the GO line project and I could see that the

31
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:19,530
route I've got my hidden get folder tells me this is gets tracking everything.

32
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,860
And so one command I have here is get branch and this will show me my branches.

33
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,610
And so I currently only have the branch master.

34
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,900
And now if I do get branch also has a dash a variant.

35
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,450
Let's hear it.

36
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,340
So get branch dash a shows.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,840
All branches that you're get knows about both on your own machine and wherever your remote host is in

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,560
this case.

39
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:48,910
So I'm going to just keep track commands used in video here and we will do get branch showed the branch

40
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,810
and and get branch related to that is dash which shows all of your branches.

41
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,030
Yes.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,400
So it's getting so get branch defaults to only showing branches that you are that your device has used

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,750
before.

44
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,960
So in this case master whereas get branch dash a is for all branch is that you know about which is step

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,930
on your device and the stuff that's on the the wherever you're cloning from in this case GitHub.

46
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,220
All branches to that

47
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,710
show.

48
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:28,730
Branches out there and and now the next thing I want to do is create my own branch.

49
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,740
So the way I've learned to do this is get check out dash B and checkout is how you check out a different

50
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:42,390
branch and then we can give it a name and I'll call this you know dog dog branch.

51
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,000
That's it.

52
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,880
And now switch to new branch dog.

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,690
You can see the command.

54
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,610
If I do get branch right there it shows me my two and if I do get branch dash.

55
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,710
It shows me the remote branch also which does not know about dog yet because you have not pushed dog.

56
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,730
So get up does not know about it so you don't see a remote origin slash dog.

57
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:07,170
You only see local dog and now you can also see the star next to the dog and that dog is green.

58
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,590
So I'm on the dog branch.

59
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:16,120
I could create a file here and I'm going to do that with nano and canine teeth.

60
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,170
And I love dogs.

61
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:18,880
What can I say.

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,050
Control X and save it and enter and I could do it get status and I see I have that.

63
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,170
And so now what I do at this point.

64
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,290
So now you can use to your get ad and commit like you normally do.

65
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,520
You add dash yes I'll get commit commit dash and commit to Ms.

66
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:49,370
Dash and adds canine file and declaration of feeling towards dogs and and now if I wanted to I could

67
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,990
do another thing I could.

68
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,090
No.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:03,260
I don't know Labrador texting likes like to fetch balls lads like to fetch balls.

70
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,640
Yes.

71
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:12,020
Enter and get add dash Ash dash a comet dash to end it.

72
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,970
I got it.

73
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:21,510
Yeah that's him and about labs and then get status and nothing to commit.

74
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,520
Working to clean.

75
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,790
So I've got those.

76
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,110
So where do I take it from here.

77
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,850
So from here is now.

78
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,000
Now you need to tell get hub about the bridge.

79
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,600
So if you just do a get push it will give you an error which actually tells you what you need to do

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,040
to fix it actually.

81
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,860
So you can see it now set is great.

82
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,840
Current branch dog has no upstream branch so basically it's saying You've got dog.

83
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,060
He doesn't know what you should be pushing dog to and it gives you a suggestion get push dash dash set

84
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:56,580
upstream origin dog which creates the dog branch on github and sets and pushes and sets it so it will

85
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,390
always do that from now on.

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,550
So I've got the branch dog on my local computer but the branch dog is not on get.

87
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,750
And so when I tried to push it's not pushing the master origin master origin is right.

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,120
Yes it's not pushing towards a master cause I'm not on branch master so it's like where do you want

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,080
to push.

90
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,880
And so if I wanted to push this branch up to get I would go ahead and enter this command and then press

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,360
enter.

92
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,240
Is that something I want to do.

93
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,620
Yes in this case this command with the state kind of thing is get push like you normally do and then

94
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:36,390
the origin dog basically says you're pushing to origin your dog branch and then the set upstream says

95
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,990
Save this as a default so that get pushed on the dog branch.

96
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,540
Now on always goes origin dog.

97
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,440
So I push this

98
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:56,920
in so now if you go to get hub you can now see the branch so just go back to the right and two branches

99
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,910
two branches and branches active branches your branches default branch.

100
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,380
My dog.

101
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:09,010
And so those are on there and and then I'm accepting emerge requests if I want to merge this into Master

102
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,640
we could see how to do that in the next video.

103
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,170
Keep the video short yeah.

104
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:13,640
All right.

105
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:21,070
So that's creating a branch and adding some files to the branch and committing those files and then

106
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,900
pushing that branch up to a new branch on your origin your remote repository.

107
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:35,620
Get hub and we'll see how to in the next video How to how to merge those merge that branch into master

108
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,760
and then also how to get rid of the branch when you're done so that's coming up.
