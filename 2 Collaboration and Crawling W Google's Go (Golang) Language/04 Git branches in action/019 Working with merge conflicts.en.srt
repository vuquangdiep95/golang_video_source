1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,010
You have the theory of branches.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,480
Why.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:02,790
Why.

4
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,210
Well first kind of talked about why they're useful.

5
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,800
It's the idea of kind of like work on this bring it in work on this bringing in more branches as opposed

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,360
to less smaller changes as opposed to larger changes to branch merging and yeah we could even demonstrate

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,670
why just look what's working and master is bad.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,340
You have a I make a change to tax and push it then you make a change without pull you make a change

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,570
in trying to push.

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,850
You can see the conflict that occurs.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,690
Sure.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:30,960
All right.

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:38,760
So now we're going to start exploring why branches are useful and this previous video that we just did

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,040
was cloning a public project.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,330
Right.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,800
Does Speedie media working.

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,010
Yeah.

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,100
And then we fought it and and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna both create changes to the same

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,600
repo without branches and we'll see how that could create some difficulties.

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,700
And so I'm going to start out and I'm going to go to my terminal and I'm inside right now going project

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:10,110
and inside there I've got that test t t and I'm gonna open that up and my editor.

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,810
So the Nano test text text text t text not text D.

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,820
And that's in here and then I'm going to add some change.

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,880
And so I just added that from Todd right.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,620
Like that's what I've just added control X save it.

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,220
And.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,140
And then well before I save it Daniel is gonna open it and he's also going to add something you could

28
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,390
see what mine looks like now.

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,980
Now we're gonna switch to Daniel's computer and he's going to open it and change the projects go for

30
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,090
it.

31
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:41,710
Okay.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,140
I just real fast reclined under the goes to a loved one instead of B Ah the great.

33
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,910
That's awesome.

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,350
And I want the collaborator.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:56,890
So I now I'm now set up as the collaborator or as as my account or Lord knows at which is a collaborator.

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,750
And so I can open up a text editor and

37
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:12,910
I can open that text file open that text file you see his doesn't have my changes yet I haven't pushed

38
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,890
him I haven't even saved him on my machine yet.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,830
So go for it.

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,630
You're at your chain.

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,000
So I can say oh I want to fix that.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,050
That was a mistake.

43
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,440
It should just be some text not some t text.

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,090
So if I save that and possibly add some additional stuff some more text and put your name after it.

45
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,480
We know that one's from me just so go and say it.

46
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,860
So it's safe now.

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:46,170
And so I've saved my life you push now and so hit it and push it I can get stats here get add that file

48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:46,990
specifically.

49
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,820
That's another option.

50
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,980
Option is you can name the files you're adding but then you have to list all of them.

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:03:01,550
So it's no green it's modified it could get Mitt and fixed type O added

52
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,750
so if I get status again it's still it's still on my machine.

53
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,770
I've got that commit but it's not yet pushed yet.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:21,640
So if I get push this change because it talks to get pushes that I can go now.

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,060
I can go here fresh the paid 21 seconds.

56
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,920
Oh my.

57
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,290
Midway through I can see some text at the T.

58
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,190
And it got right here and now I'm back in my file and I'm gonna save mine.

59
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,160
So I'm gonna file name to write as tech start to 60s and now minds save.

60
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,970
And if we look at my my file right you could see my file some t text and add some change from Todd.

61
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:55,080
There's nothing about Daniel's effects fix taking away that some t text and his lines not there obviously

62
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,800
just on my machine.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:07,030
So I'm going to get add a dash a get commit dash and my boss is a blowhard no pride not a good command

64
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,600
message

65
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:20,200
adds a new line to text file and then get push and when I push it's going to say rejected failed to

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,950
push some raps to get updates rejected because remote teams work that you do not have locally this is

67
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,780
usually caused by another repository pushing to the same ref you may want to first integrate the remote

68
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,590
changes get pull before pushing again see know about passports and get push for details so what do you

69
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,640
recommend we do at this point follow those directions so it's good to get pulled do the get pulled is

70
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:51,770
the first step and so automatic merge failed fix conflicts and then commit the result so we have emerged

71
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,780
conflict text so so when you get pull sometimes get is able to figure it out.

72
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,490
So for example if I just deleted that T without adding more lines get would probably have figured it

73
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,140
out because I changed the line that he that his changes didn't effect and he changed lines that might

74
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,540
in effect it would've just been able to automatically merge it but because I added some things and he

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,130
added some lines at the bottom of the file get wasn't able to figure that out automatically.

76
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:23,150
So it tells him there's a there's a conflict in text 2016 and if he doesn't get status it will show

77
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,430
him that it's well it says both modified text at T T.

78
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,240
So now if he opens text out t t he can see the conflict.

79
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:45,170
So with that text so so you can see a get adds conflicts in this rather odd manner it has a bunch of

80
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,910
less than science and then what you're Kurt and then what it's called on your own machine.

81
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,980
So in this case head which usually means where you're currently working and then it's got some equal

82
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,140
signs in the energy and the bottom it's got a bunch of greater than signs and a commit number.

83
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,260
So this was years so so stuff here was so.

84
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,230
That's your comment.

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,030
No.

86
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,110
OK.

87
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,730
And then the head head is almost always what you've done yourself.

88
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,520
Yeah so to fix this I actually just start editing this file and save it right.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,000
So get rid of that I bring this up I say get rid of that and then I come down here and I get rid of

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,350
this and and then I come down here and I get rid of that

91
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,410
and I'm like that's what we want the file to look like.

92
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:39,070
So I control X and then I hit y to save it and I hit enter and I do get status updates you get stat

93
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,530
it still says it's book both modified seeds you get seed you get add on that.

94
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,170
You add that file name or dash a.

95
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,750
Now if you get status it will say.

96
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,430
This is changes to be committed so you just get commit without a dash in without.

97
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,250
Okay.

98
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,110
Tell me why.

99
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,520
So when you get with this is creating a merge commit and then the merge commit has a default message

100
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,200
already.

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,890
So you can add the dash M and put it in the custom message for this merge commit.

102
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,500
But the default message is usually good for merge conflict fixing document.

103
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,070
So it will actually open your editor still but it's got the default message already so you can just

104
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,880
ex the editor.

105
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:27,650
So in this case it's a vim so I believe it's and you will exit you call and Q Yeah.

106
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:34,710
So now if you get yes now if you get statuses you can see that it gets that it shows it's been committed

107
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,470
and you push.

108
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:43,060
So that was kind of a laborious process where you have emerge conflict you have to open the file manually

109
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,120
fix it then you have to.

110
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,910
The hardest part.

111
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,860
Get out of them.

112
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,940
Yes.

113
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,950
You went them.

114
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,480
And then you push it.

115
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:58,810
So so back over at my machine now if I refresh this page I can now see this merge Chase merged page

116
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,970
4 file and add branches helps us avoid those conflicts and idea well we'll talk about the idea of branches

117
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,490
you want to do more branches than last and smaller commits as opposed to larger commands when you're

118
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,080
working with people that way you see what everybody is doing more frequently.

119
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,930
Correct yeah.

120
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,100
And less conflicts and less conflicts.

121
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,540
All right we'll do that next video.
