1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,460
So one of the cool things about get out of here on Daniel's computer you could see that if you go up

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,540
Well I'll let you show it.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,060
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,310
Yeah.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,770
So get up actually has a bunch of stuff that gives you over here on this insights tab.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,510
Lots of.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,490
But the one I find most helpful most often is the network area.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:27,870
So this network area shows all commits all branches all forks from this repo that have happened.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,700
And so you can see here's the original comment.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,980
The for storage book.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,790
Here's where both Todd and I made a both made a commit in the merge commit and now down here you can

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,940
see the dog branch and it's even labeled dog dog branches at this commit currently where its master

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:53,160
is this commit and you can also see the forked the forked repo down here with its own commit and so

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,110
you can that you can actually see the lines as they merge back together and split apart and just kind

15
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,960
of visually track what's going on with your branches and that's moving left to right or the right is

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,740
the future so as we continue to add stuff you'll see it growing out to the right.

17
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,520
Correct yes.

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,290
And you can drag it around too to actually see stuff to go back and forth.

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,510
So one thing to add is that before you create a branch it's important to know what branch you're on

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,400
because you get to create a branch off of any branch.

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,990
It can be a master branch of a dog fight fires on dog and one to create another branch I could create

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,410
a branch right off of dog so I can demonstrate that here.

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:38,200
So I get pull to pull everything I can see it sees oh there's now a new branch.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,530
And if I get it branch I just see master but if I get branch dash a I can see remote origin dog and

25
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,230
I can get check out dog.

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,700
No no dash B dash B is for creating a branch.

27
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,770
Get check out just branch it by itself.

28
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,840
Just goes to that branch.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,730
Also no I do not need to put remotes origin dog I just put the actual branch name dog and so now switch

30
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,680
to a new branch dog and if I get branch now I'm now on dog.

31
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,950
And from here I can get I can get check out dash B

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:28,260
detailed detailed dog and now I'm on new branch detailed dog get branch dog

33
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:41,440
which currently that's still the same as dog but if I then make some changes like I open up this canine

34
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:50,840
96 t say put capital ii there for example I love your attention at all.

35
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Get met proper grammar is important which I don't know how to spell grammar.

36
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,180
Yeah it's a G

37
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:13,580
now I push this I will say it will get I almost that ver just know this command I just don't I almost

38
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:21,740
always just do the get push and then copy paste it it's not a command we're memorizing given that it

39
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:28,430
tells you what you're supposed to do to fix it like a so now if I go back to this network tab and I

40
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,270
refresh

41
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,160
I can now see.

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:42,010
Dog is there in detail dog is a separate is off dog doesn't do the little interesting little if something

43
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,900
else is committed to dog it will put it'll push this down so you see that dog is still standing let's

44
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,810
add a file to your detail dog and see that switch see what happened so that it's back at dog so if I

45
00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:02,310
go if I get checked out back to dog and I create a new fire so note this canine guy takes yes that works

46
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:09,170
I still because detail dog is where I got fixed not dog I can now create a new file

47
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,210
of smart

48
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:33,480
I can get add all commit and I like poodles push whereas Mangum it's up on the fly yes

49
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:46,510
so now if I refresh the page here now naked see they pulled the tail dog off into its own line again

50
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:54,020
the nice well we've got some confusing stuff to clean up here yeah and the main thing one of the main

51
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,160
things you want to take away from this is that when you create a new branch you create that branch off

52
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,850
of whatever branch you're currently on and it's also always good to do a get pull and I put that in

53
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:14,410
red here in the video above before creating a branch do a get pull you know so get your current state

54
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:23,040
of the remote repository with a get pull so before you create a branch you get pull so everything's

55
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,640
current then create your branch what ever branch your arm and you create a branch creating branch off

56
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,060
of that and then when you're ready to check branch out from master to just get check out branch name

57
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,900
which you could see right here get check out branch name.

58
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,720
Ready for the next video or shall we say getting more on this one.

59
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,450
That's it.

60
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:40,760
All right.

61
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,490
See the next one.
