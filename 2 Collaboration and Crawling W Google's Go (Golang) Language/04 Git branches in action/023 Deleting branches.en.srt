1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,420
All right.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,820
So now we're going to see how to delete branches and annual shows how do I see it.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,760
So once you've got branches merge you probably want to clean them up so you get branch.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,920
You can see detailed dog and dog are still there even though they've been merged into master.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,080
So do eat a branch.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,890
It's got branch dash D for delete in the name of the branch that do eat a branch dog.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,540
However this only deletes it on your own machine.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:38,720
So if I get branch dash a remote origin still has the dog and pushing does not affect this at all if

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,550
I push says everything's already up to date.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:50,480
If I pull everything still up to date get branch dash a still shows get hub still has dog.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,500
So if you go to your repo and you hit the branches on GitHub you can go into.

12
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,660
You can see the dog branch and you can delete it.

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,840
There is delete it on github.

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:16,320
Now if I can get pull and already update still but and if I get branch dash a it still sees dog now

15
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,830
the reason for this is just that get is caching that it's it's it's that it saw that there was a branch

16
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,640
called dog at one point in time so it still keeps that around even though it's not actually there anymore.

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,320
So what you need to do to do that is get remote rune origin.

18
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,890
This was yes.

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,660
So you get remote prune origin.

20
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:48,580
This tells get to good to check origin and prune out any branches that we've got cached that origin

21
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,820
no longer has.

22
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:56,290
So you can see it says pruned origin dog and if you get branch dash egg and see it no longer has dog

23
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,080
tags so and you can do this in the or other order too.

24
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,080
I can delete detail dog

25
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,650
and if I get remote prune Orange says detail dog is gone.

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,950
Get branch dash a It Gets gone here.

27
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,750
But I still have my local copy so I need to eat my local copy as well detailed

28
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,960
branch.

29
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,150
Now I'm all cleaned up.

30
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:35,830
We just have mastered now we've got master local and then we have our remote origin master origin HEAD.

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,700
SO head is just basically the default where we're currently at.

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,660
So remote origin is that currently which is at Master head is that master that's pointing it's almost

33
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,350
like an alias for origin master the madam or master.

34
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,880
Yes.

35
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,210
Okay great.

36
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,010
That was awesome.

37
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,150
I really liked seeing the leading branches so yeah.

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,380
Todd still has his copies of those two branches as or you never got detailed dog so you don't even.

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,550
Yeah.

40
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:09,420
Let's take a look and let's clean me up so get branch books get branch DSA DSA and I am on dogs I need

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:19,320
to do get check out master and and then get branch Dash and I use my arrow keys to cycle through commands

42
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:26,610
they're previously done commands and then I'm gonna do a get branch dash D and get rid of dog shape

43
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,560
poll first see what happens when you pull if you it doesn't work matter too much.

44
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,840
One thing to note though is if you do a branch delete where it does not know that it's been merged because

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,270
you haven't pulled yet for example get we'll give you a warning so.

46
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,530
So if you tried to delete dog before pulling so your computer doesn't know that dogs emerged yet get

47
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,500
will warn you and give you the command to force it to be deleted anyway.

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,780
Which I believe is just capital the avoid I remember.

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:08,930
So now I've gotten rid of dog and I want to do my get remote remote print origin to see if anything

50
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:15,140
can be cleaned up and I got rid of a remote origin dog so I'm all good to go to.

51
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,030
That's the leading branches the guy thing you want to add to that.

52
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:19,690
That's right.

53
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,130
Tweet branches.

54
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,650
Good stuff.
