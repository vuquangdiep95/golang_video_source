1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,510
So do we want to for the first bit demonstrate why branches are a good idea.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,910
Having us both make commit and try to push like both of us try to change this text.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,420
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:09,830
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,930
So that's good on your screen recorder's gone.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,120
Yes.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm just going to say that stuff like a pilot my screen records go on this go on and we're recording

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,210
audio recording video recording all that.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,470
Just a moment.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,410
Yeah sure.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:25,770
Yeah.

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,680
That's got the red record gone all right.

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,890
So another great thing about pair programming pair teaching is that Daniel just had a suggestion and

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:40,550
in the sentiment that effort the vein providing too much information rather than not enough.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,070
True to what I said in the last video we're going to do something in this video.

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,940
And Daniel suggestion was to show how you clone.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,770
So we're going to see that how somebody else clones it as a collaborator or anybody could clone it the

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,460
way you're to do.

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,030
Yes.

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,100
All right let's do it.

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,320
Yeah.

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:55,860
So.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,280
So I can just go to the project which I can if I know the full year old project that's there or from

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,750
the email from last time or I can just go to get hubcap and you can search for a repo so I can just

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:21,680
search for it goes to goes to 11:00 if I can spell slash going project I think my goes to Levin is with

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,490
bashes.

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,990
There we go.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,880
No it's not.

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:24,850
Surprise me.

30
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,560
So that goes straight to it culturally if you are a collaborator for something it will show up over

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,720
here that's your list of your repositories so you can hit show more if you want to see all the repositories

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:44,750
that you have access to so either way once you are on the project page again if you're not a collaborator

33
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:51,890
you can fork it whether you are a collaborator or not if you can access the page you can hit close and

34
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:58,430
you can close that sage or if you're not using a sage there's HP s version but a sage is usually better.

35
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,750
Anybody could fork it too.

36
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,790
You don't have to collaborate correct and forking it would then make it a repo.

37
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,060
That is exactly like this one.

38
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,210
But under your account.

39
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,570
Correct.

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:08,900
So.

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,530
So if I hit a fork here I would now have an oral auto slash going project.

42
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah.

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,350
Copy and then anybody can also clone this contract.

44
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,420
Yeah bring it down to the machine because it's public.

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,020
Yes.

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,180
Right.

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,050
So once they clone it I can get the clone button here.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,720
They've got a couple different options.

49
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,620
But what you want is the cloning.

50
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,520
You are all here.

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,740
So I want the sage cloning.

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,830
I can spent to copy it or I can click this and it controls see either one works and then I can go to

53
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:44,900
my command prompt and I'll just do it on my desktop get cloned and then I put that you are all and that

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:52,030
clones it onto my own machine and and this is one because I cloned it through this particular clone

55
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,420
button.

56
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,200
It is cloned off of it goes to eleven going project.

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:04,310
If you are forking it you will be cloning off you off of your fork not the original project whatever

58
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,230
you clone off of that's what you're.

59
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,030
That's what you're by default.

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,130
That is what you will try to push back to you.

61
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,000
And if you do if you're not a collaborator or pushes will fail

62
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,340
so that's just adjusting the volume if you see me do stuff like that.

63
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,270
So so.

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,130
So if I was not a collaborator I could clone like this.

65
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,010
But then if I tried to write back to this repository the when I do get push it would give me an error

66
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,540
message and it wouldn't actually go through.

67
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,190
So instead what I would do in that case is that I would fork it.

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,350
I would clone that I do my work there.

69
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,750
And I could push to my fork and then I could come back to and try to request that my changes get pulled

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,720
back to the original repository.

71
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,750
So let me just make sure I understand this.

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:57,670
And we have goes to Levin going project and let's say that I am James Bond.

73
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,700
I've got my James Bond github account and I'm really realizing the power of coding that this entire

74
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,080
thing and run around guns and dynamite fistfight with people.

75
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,910
It's not the way to make things happen in the world.

76
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,630
You really want to be powerful you've got to be a coder so that I can then go to goes to Levin and go

77
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,620
and project you're actually looking to see some he's got James Bond account.

78
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,110
That's great.

79
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,700
I think somebody has to grab that username.

80
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,670
It's already taken one and that makes sense.

81
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,560
And then if I clone my.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,650
That goes to Levin Go line project if I make changes to that I can tell to make changes locally.

83
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,810
But then you know there's no way for me to save those changes on GitHub because unless I'm submitting

84
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,520
it to goes to Levin whereas if I fork it it's going to be under my account I can make all the changes

85
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,990
I want I could submit it to my account.

86
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,410
Right.

87
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,750
So all add files work on files as you go through the project with a fork.

88
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,590
You could do this and then send all those up to your fort Go Go line project under your account name

89
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,030
and then if you ever create something that you want to add to the goes to Levin you could select that

90
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:11,090
one thing you can make a pull request so I've made 10 things I'm keeping under my username my repo my

91
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,570
fork of it 10 things.

92
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,260
But then I'm like oh I want to send seven and add that to the project.

93
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,000
I could do a pull request.

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,970
I want to know the poor request does not go by the command.

95
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,230
It goes by the branch which is what we'll be getting into next.

96
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,630
So if you make 10 changes on the main branch you can make a pull request have that branch merged into

97
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,420
the original.

98
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,150
Okay.

99
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,710
So and that's and that includes all the changes that you've made on that bridge.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,920
So to get that version I was talking about we really need to be able to use branches.

101
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,070
And then I'll make branches as I'm doing stuff.

102
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,930
And then if one on one of those branches and like this would be good for everybody's to see I could

103
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,310
smell that one branch.

104
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,590
I like that anything more.

105
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,430
No.

106
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,770
So I now have I now have it set up on my.

107
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,900
I've now closed it on my system so I couldn't have a go link project which on windows you don't have

108
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,020
lets you use DIY R for direct for directory.

109
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,040
And so I've got that text that text on my system.

110
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,670
Awesome.

111
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,940
All right.

112
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,010
So in the next video we'll start working with branches.
