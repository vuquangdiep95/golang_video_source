1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,440
Wait.

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,080
No I do.

3
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,930
I told you I'd throw away get hub accounts.

4
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,060
I mean I guess I do have access to our greater company.

5
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,880
Awesome.

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,010
Oh really.

7
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,220
Yeah.

8
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,770
We had one.

9
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,390
Oh yeah.

10
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,160
And we just see that.

11
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,750
Let's just see that this is how most people will see it right.

12
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,760
Mm hmm.

13
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,180
Let me know if you're thirsty.

14
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:16,430
Me.

15
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,520
Are you thirsty.

16
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,950
Water

17
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,340
maybe came to me.

18
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,080
Probably.

19
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,330
So now Daniel has logged in to and we're looking at Daniel's screen here on Windows.

20
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,910
But Daniel is logged into a kind of you know just get hub user account and and the user account here.

21
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,160
So this is he's no longer a collaborator from this user accounts.

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,820
This is the way most people will experience this repost we've kind of wanted to do it from get Hub Repository

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,190
where the person individuals not collaborators.

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,280
So if you could go to your username here you could see its greater Common's font.

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,970
Awesome is the name of this account and now he's also gone to ghost eleven go Lang project.

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,510
Now he's gonna fork this we're gonna do it as a fork and we're gonna start working on branches so take

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:12,990
it away.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,440
So yeah.

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,130
One thing to note is this is what it looks like as a non collaborator versus as a collaborator.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,760
There's very little difference here.

31
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,330
All the all the same tabs and such.

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,870
I could turn off my.

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,380
Yeah you say one looks like it's night turn I can turn off my dark dark appearance there.

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,660
So as you can see the changes are tiny.

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,120
My the one that's a collaborator has a suggestion to add a read me and that's about the only difference

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,760
there.

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,430
So that's because this project is public so old all the same options are available and I can clone this

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,200
but I wouldn't be able to push if I closed in this way so I can fork it by clicking this work button

39
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,270
and that will tell get hub to fork it.

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,360
So it's working the project can take not it's fairly fast and so now I've got very common spot awesome

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,760
slash going project.

42
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,590
And it knows it has a little note here.

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,860
It was forked from goes to heaven project and then at the terminal or you're going you're going to work

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,950
from the command prompt but you have to bash shell commands enabled there correct.

45
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,140
I've got to get installed to get SBN.

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,370
OK so so I've got all the standard get commands and so we're going to start to create a branch.

47
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:37,790
So you could you know maybe add your own file so let's do one where we add a file on a branch that's

48
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,000
just going to be pushed Uri Po and then let's do one where we add a file that will then be submitted

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,220
as a pull request to the main Ricoh.

50
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,860
And so for this first one let's just add a file and push it to your repo and we'll compare that to the

51
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,070
repo under.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:01,700
So first let me delete my googling project folder here because I was the one under your other that was

53
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,800
that was the one clone dwarf.

54
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,480
If the goes to 11 again.

55
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,900
So now it's gone.

56
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,230
So if I do dir it's no longer there.

57
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,530
How did you delete that.

58
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,800
I just went to my death is on my desktop so it's like that was fast.

59
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,400
So we're on Windows to delete a folder from the command line is an incredibly well it's not incredibly

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,810
complicated but it's different enough.

61
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,980
I don't actually remember off the top my head.

62
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,150
The arm.

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,550
RF Yeah.

64
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,910
Lizzy It's the ads.

65
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,480
It's a lot easier.

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,360
So I'm not going to go with that stage because it goes to heaven because the greater common so far awesome

67
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,760
account does not have my s h set up some screens HD yes which allows me to use my username username

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,220
and password instead.

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,430
So get a clone.

70
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,070
Yeah the HD.

71
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,820
Yes you are.

72
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,970
Because this is a public this is a public project it does not require credentials to clone it.

73
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,490
So even though I didn't have to type it in at this point.

74
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,550
So now I need to create a file of some sort.

75
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:19,010
So I can if I just open up a text editor here and I just create a new file with it.

76
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,720
This is a sample file I say.

77
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:35,500
Over in the test coding project here they call it text to

78
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:45,730
now I can run the commands get status and I can see what I have to be in the actual folder get status

79
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,520
I can see the new file and I can get add Dutch capital a.

80
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,810
So now I get status it's ready and I can do.

81
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:07,210
Get a mint dash and added a new file these are your commands by the way it's like I get ad get come

82
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:15,510
and get push and get ad dash a or dash dash all in the passive use get ad dash dash on Daniel.

83
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,990
Be like why you just do dash capital they both work.

84
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,080
So now they've added If I get status I can see there's nothing to commit but your branch is ahead of

85
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,010
origin master origin just refers to wherever you cloned it from.

86
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,100
So in this case it's greater common off the Golden project by one commit.

87
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:48,700
And so now I can get push this this commit and it's through and I can refresh the page refresh or wherever

88
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,890
and there's the new file and this is this is under greater Commons font awesome going project.

89
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,610
Yes if I go to yes thank you if they go back to the original.

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,360
No they're not there.

91
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:07,630
And so if we wanted to add something to the original under goes to eleven then you need to do that on

92
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,700
a branch you can you can do it on this you can do it on this master is a branch.

93
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,830
So type in it technically.

94
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:20,910
So if I want to have this pushed over to the original I need to create a pull request.

95
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,800
And so I think I go to the pull request tab hit you or request

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:37,080
and so you can see it says base repository goes to eleven going project and head repository you can

97
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,220
see it's got a little error here.

98
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:47,140
So stuff from this end greater comments my awesome master is going to great goes to eleven master but

99
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,780
if you'd made a whole bunch of changes on a master then it's going to try to send them all over and

100
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,490
now where you want the individual branch you send one little thing over so that's one of the benefits.

101
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,180
So yeah I can get more than just master branch you can see you can select which one and you can also

102
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,840
select which one you're pushing it over to two if the head if the original has multiple branches.

103
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,690
That's pretty cool.

104
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,650
All right so go ahead and so.

105
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,830
So yeah once once you've you can see a little preview of what's being moved over and then when you read

106
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,650
each that create pull request and it'll ask you to describe your request if you are doing a poor request

107
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,620
to a public to an actual public open source project one as much detail as you can in here.

108
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:36,940
So here I to say I added in there example file.

109
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:45,070
So usually one more detail than that but this works to integrate or best now because he goes love and

110
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:52,030
great going project is that poor request has one pull request and as a collaborator I my system just

111
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,430
got an email saying there is a new poll request Todd probably also got an email saying as much just

112
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,300
now.

113
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,830
But now Todd can now go to this pull request tab and you'll see my new pull request and he'll be able

114
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,810
to say that you're you're a collaborator under this account.

115
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,550
Yes I'm a clerk so yeah I can go to my account where I'm logged in as me and I can refresh the page

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,640
I can see the poor request you can see here it is by Greer comments.

117
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:32,190
Awesome I made the comment there I can check what the permits were added a new file I can see the file

118
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:41,040
changes and then when I'm ready I can then go to merge port request which accepts the changes or if

119
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,000
I say it's if I say it's done just close the port request you send a message if you're close you can

120
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,200
you can cut out a comment closing comment do.

121
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,840
This makes no sense closed for class.

122
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,930
All right let's close it next.

123
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,980
Yeah.

124
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,040
Close it was close it.

125
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,730
Next we'll show we'll show branches everything you want and this is meaningless.

126
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,390
Those records that adds that this is meaningless and it close it.

127
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:16,100
And the original person my the greater comments can now see this comment with the closed.

128
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,770
All right great.

129
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,730
Next video we'll start working with branches.
