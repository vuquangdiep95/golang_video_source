1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,740
So now we're going to add Daniel as a collaborator to this get hub repo.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,640
I thought we'd be jumping into branches next but then Daniel said hey how about we show this and I was

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,370
like yes absolutely.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,090
So how do we add a collaborator.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,660
And I have to do it on my machine because obviously you don't have access there.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,560
So you tell me what to do.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:19,890
So.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
So there's a settings tab there at the top.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,500
That's where the repo not for the entire account.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,070
Yes.

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,990
And then on the left there there will be collaborator collaborators.

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:36,690
So you have to confirm your password so that if you're pre logged in for to get hub you will.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,140
It wants you to reconfirm your password.

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,830
If it's been a while since you've been passwords that someone just coming across your laptop that you've

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,680
left unlocked can't change something vital to your project

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,320
so.

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,390
So while Todd goes and looks up his password.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:03,200
So the collaborators have access to the brief on the same way the Creator does which is separate from

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:11,630
most open source projects you're allowed to fork or basically clone a project and you can do your work

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,840
and then you have to request that your changes get pulled into the original repo.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,650
A collaborator has full access and can just directly write to the other repo.

22
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,990
So I think I think we're almost here now.

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,910
It is all right.

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:40,830
I stopped my screen recording to log in there and get my password because that's super sensitive stuff.

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,140
And we'll see if there we go we're logged in.

26
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,270
So you're saying that isn't this fun.

27
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,340
First of all I should have seen this fine.

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,120
Like I'm telling you I'm fun.

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,610
So we're so much alike.

30
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:58,630
Life can be like particularly encoding like you're there by yourself you're learning that your I don't

31
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,040
know your code in it right.

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,640
Like you spent a lot of salt solitary time just go go go.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,070
Yes.

34
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,230
And like it's totally like back when Barnabas was here like when you're kind of Barnabas.

35
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,150
That was awesome.

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,660
Yes.

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,240
And it's fun to have company doing this together.

38
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,230
I'm having a good time.

39
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,280
So you're saying Jump in anytime you can talk fast.

40
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,970
Yes.

41
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,280
You were saying collaborators versus somebody else but it could be a collaborator versus just anyone

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,090
in a for an open source project a collaborator has access to the original repo whereas anyone else has

43
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,030
to fork the repo into a copy of their own and then request that one of the collaborators pulls their

44
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,650
changes into the original repo.

45
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,770
Yeah.

46
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,480
So when I was talking about somebody being a what's a set that's the dark knight.

47
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,200
Right.

48
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,830
Yes.

49
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,860
Jed I want to talk about somebody.

50
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,600
And my my lack of Star Wars knowledge to show through when nice talking about somebody being a Jedi.

51
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,540
They'd be a collaborator if they wanted to be open and accept pull requests.

52
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm going to type in your username here and get yes there it is.

53
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,530
Or Lord knows and I liked that name it sounds.

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,400
I just invited you it sounds it sounds like powerful and mysterious and like some esoteric piece of

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,810
knowledge like Dungeons and Dragons or something.

56
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,370
I think that's a good good name.

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,160
My user name obviously comes from maybe not so obvious now.

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,850
An old movie in the 80s by Rob Reiner called Spinal Tap.

59
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:33,730
You could You could YouTube goes to eleven Spinal Tap and watch where my name came from.

60
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:33,950
All right.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,920
So Daniel is going to accept the invitation.

62
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,470
So when I got invited I got an email saying I was invited and that brings me here where I can accept

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,890
the invitation to be a collaborator.

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,850
And now that now I am now.

65
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,920
I now have push access to the goes to 11 going project repository.

66
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,820
So now I am capable of doing all the same commands as Todd is with the exception of I can't rename the

67
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,710
project.

68
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,920
I can't just collaborators they can't delete the project.

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,960
There may be a few other administrative things that only the owner can do.

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,200
You're giving me a lot of credit there that you could be able to do all the same commands I could do.

71
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,460
Daniel's got it on me when it comes to get.

72
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,880
He knows a lot of good get.

73
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,600
All right.

74
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,650
You have anything more you want to say about all that.

75
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,420
We've got the collaborator set up to be a collaborator requires the owner to get set up forking is just

76
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,280
anyone can go to the repo and just hit the fork button the upper right mean that they'll create your

77
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,630
own copy which you can work on and then you can go back to the original one and create a pull request.

78
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,220
Yeah.

79
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,760
Yeah.

80
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,900
So that's that's great.

81
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,540
And starring is just keeping track of the ones you like and you like and watching Latino and there's

82
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,680
changes sweet.

83
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,450
All right.

84
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,210
I think that's good.

85
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,210
We'll see in the next video where we're going to do something.
