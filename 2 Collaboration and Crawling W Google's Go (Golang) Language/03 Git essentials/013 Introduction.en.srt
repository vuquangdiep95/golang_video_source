1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:09,570
I'm excited to have my friend and colleague and fellow venture fellow adventurer and start ups Daniel

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:18,300
here with me and Daniel has the advantage and benefit of being a practicing professional coder so I

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,160
already explained this but in academia I spend all my time kind of teaching the same classes and that's

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,820
different than being a professional dad where you're working on all kinds of different parts.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:34,560
I'm really excited to have you here Daniel and I'm looking forward to going through this material and

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,810
learning some new things myself and kind of exemplifying pair programming.

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:46,380
So we have a little bit a wider lens on now you could see a little bit more of the room and the first

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,840
thing we're gonna do is just kind of go in to some get stuff and so it gets stuff that I notice a lot

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,470
of my students whether they're undergraduates or graduate students they don't always have these skills

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,120
and even when I teach people who are in industry sometimes I find that some people don't have these

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,560
skills and so this is going to be we're going to end this section here you could see from the outline

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,030
we're going to look at get we're gonna setup our get repo in this video and and so you know you'll have

13
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,370
a link to that and of course resources where the code is and then we're gonna work with branches a little

14
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,070
bit so we're going to go through understanding branches and working at branches and doing def master

15
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,030
branch you could see the videos coming up as a little bit of a preview of what's coming in this section

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,100
and then merging a branch into leading a branch.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,330
So we're just laying the foundation and I really believe in being thorough because nothing is more frustrating

18
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,280
when you're trying to learn something than watching somebody do something and not understanding what

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,300
they're doing.

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,030
So if you already know all of the things that are mentioned there this is your course for your benefit.

21
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,450
We're here to help you if you already know this stuff feel free to skip over this section but if you

22
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,240
don't know this and I really believe in providing too much rather than not enough.

23
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,340
And so along with that philosophy I'd rather you have material if you need it and that way it's there

24
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,270
for you so you can go through it and if you don't need it you could step over it.

25
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,840
And so that's why we're including this information it's kind of like the next step up of what I've covered

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,900
in my previous courses which was an introduction to get.

27
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,960
And so if you don't understand get at all you want to step back to one of my earlier courses.

28
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,800
So that's what we're going to do in this section.

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,090
But I've been doing all the talking do you have anything you want to add.

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,260
No not really.

31
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:45,120
So the the skill set here and any good team and you get partnership you have complementary skill sets.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,980
And so my skill set is teaching.

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,580
I've spent a lot of time talking in front of other people and sharing ideas and learning how to convey

34
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,190
ideas thus I have part of my brain that's really well developed do that doesn't mean I don't completely

35
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:06,670
screw it up at times I went to New York this summer to do a presentation and just the tension of life

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,850
the pressure the high level I was operating out back there I wasn't happy with how it turned down I

37
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:17,670
got nervous sometimes still happens so I'm good at presenting and professional DAB I just don't have

38
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,430
that experience whereas Daniel complements that and say you're gonna we're gonna have that benefit of

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:29,040
both of us here where he has professional experience it's been working with go professionally for wow

40
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:36,450
many years now and so that's what we're going to do and that's what we're looking at in this first section

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,940
and you got anything else you want to say looking forward to teaching.

42
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,170
He'll be talking more when we get into the coding and I'll make sure that I'm slowing things down to

43
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,250
you know make sure all things are under well understood.

44
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,560
All right.

45
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,160
So we'll jump in to get in the next video.
