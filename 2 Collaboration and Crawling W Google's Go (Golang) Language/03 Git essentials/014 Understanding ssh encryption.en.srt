1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,250
I'm just going to ease Daniel in here and I'm going to take the lead on this first part.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,050
This first video.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,610
This video right now.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,400
And that's just create our get repo and I'm just going to briefly just review a few things and then

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,640
also maybe Daniel you could show windows and so how you get bashed commands on windows and again all

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,910
this stuff ah is in my previous court previous course is what we're going to cover here.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,460
So this is just f y.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,290
Maybe you're still new to this and you need a little bit of reinforcement or review or maybe your completely

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:38,910
new to it in which case it's just convenient for you that it's right here but to set up a get hub repo

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,580
the first thing you want to do is you want to make sure that you could clone using SS H.

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,670
There's many ways to skin a cat.

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,150
I don't know where that phrase came from.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:55,980
Probably some hillbillies out in the boondocks who like skinning cats but there's many way different

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,660
ways you could do things and and so I like using SS H I just find it easier is that your preference.

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,820
Yeah this searches easier you do have to remember your password and it's more secure too.

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,820
Well there you go.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,060
That's why I'm excited to have a pair programming pair teaching because you get additional perspectives

18
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,920
so SS age.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,450
Those are all really good reasons to use it.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,990
But if you're on Windows creating SS age can be a pain.

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:30,660
And so what's easiest is to use bash shell terminal commands on Windows.

22
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,470
So there's two main types of operating systems.

23
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:41,100
Windows or posits Unix Linux Mac right to families and then the terminals the command line interface

24
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:48,660
and the the the commands which I think are primarily used in programming are going to be Unix Linux

25
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,090
terminal shell bash as opposed to the DOS prompt command prompt which is Windows right.

26
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,570
Correct.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,200
Yeah.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,740
Yeah.

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,630
What you've experienced in programming too.

30
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,260
Yes.

31
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:58,910
Yeah.

32
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:07,160
The thing is most of those Unix bash command line commands are also available on Windows.

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,860
You just have to dig and find them and install yourself.

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,340
Yeah.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,420
So hassle.

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,510
So it's just easier.

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,320
So one way that you could setup get.

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,930
Yeah I'm sorry.

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,070
One way you could set up a bash shell terminal commands on Windows just install it get ACM and I think

40
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,100
that's the easiest way to do it.

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,120
And when you install get SVM again you can check out my course on VSO code.

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,710
I just went through this in detail.

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,980
It will it will ask you different options but you just want to make sure you're selecting the right

44
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,920
options when you select the right options.

45
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,210
You'll be able to use and just read through the choices and some are like recommended choice.

46
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,370
You'll be able to be able to use Linux shell bash terminal commands on Windows.

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:59,430
Alternatively there's one other way you could do it and on Windows machines you could enable windows

48
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,380
to do Shell bash terminal commands.

49
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,900
Yeah when Windows 10 has a Linux subsystem for Windows which basically gives you an a boon to command

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,330
line with all the boon to commands that can run when X commands directly.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,640
So if you want to do that I just google that here when the windows linux subsystem you can enable that

52
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,910
and then you can get back going on your machine to do these commands.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,020
Once you've done all that you can then run SS H to create a SS H.

54
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:36,750
Public and private key and so SS H on Mac is what I'm gonna Google and I'll give you a command.

55
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,170
And so how to SS H on mac with native SS H client and so I'm just going to scroll down until I find

56
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:43,990
the command.

57
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,310
And that's not it.

58
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,380
And so I'm just going to search for another one.

59
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,720
How to create create create.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,560
SS H key Mac.

61
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,200
Let's try that one manually generated your SS key.

62
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:02,340
SS each key in Mac and so the command here is this one right here.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,290
And so if I go to my Mac and again intermediate course so it's going to actually take me a minute to

64
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,490
kind of drop into that mode and not try to teach everything from the beginning.

65
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,470
So I'm trying to find that right place of showing too much vs. too little.

66
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,330
And so if this is going too fast for you.

67
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,450
Drop back to my earlier courses and go through those classes.

68
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:30,630
So here I'm just going to search for my SS H folder and you can see it right there and I'm gonna drop

69
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,170
that in.

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:39,420
Well I could see what's in that SS H folder first into into SS H C D dot SS H.

71
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,790
Go and I could see in there I have a public and I have a private key and so this is public private key

72
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,980
encryption.

73
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,180
It's asymmetric encryption is referred to as asymmetric encryption because there is a public key and

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,300
so this dot pub you could share this with anybody in the world.

75
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,720
And then there is a private key and this private key you want to keep for yourself.

76
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,780
And so I would think it's a good practice to generate like I'm generating as the search key forget I'm

77
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,070
only going to do that.

78
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,430
Like get Hubble have its own unique public key is that good practice.

79
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,650
It doesn't matter it's public key.

80
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,750
Anybody can have it right.

81
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,890
Anyone can have the public key.

82
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,430
So if you want to be extra secure you can have separate private and public eats but then you have to

83
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,480
flip between them while you're using it.

84
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,930
But when you go to a place that's kind of different.

85
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,300
So different Web sites if they want my SS HQ it's totally fine to provide this Publix as Publix for

86
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,720
everybody.

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,510
You get invited to.

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,910
So never mind on that.

89
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,510
So you just want to create this and to do that you drop that command in right there as you could see

90
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,620
on my terminal I hit enter and now it says enter the file in which to save the key.

91
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:49,960
So that's going to fall to idea underscore RSA and I could say I'm just gonna create tab creating temp

92
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,600
and no passphrase if I wanted extra security create a passphrase and now if I look at what's in there

93
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,750
I've got my temp and temp pub and so the pub I'm gonna cap that right.

94
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,720
So temped up pub and they'll print out what that is this is everybody can see it including you.

95
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,730
I'm going to highlight all of that and then I'm going to go to get so I'm going to go get an ID get

96
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,840
a job I'm going to go into my user settings so settings and I'm gonna go to SS H and GP keys.

97
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,490
I'm going to add a new SS H key and this would be like What.

98
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,790
You know my home desktop or whatever and I drop that in so that key gets dropped in and then I add that

99
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,250
SS HQ I'm not going to do that.

100
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:40,130
I already have one but now what that enables when get hub has my public key is they could encrypt a

101
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,840
message and send it to me and nobody else in the world could decrypt it to decrypt it.

102
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,600
You have to have the private key.

103
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:53,630
So only I can decrypt it when I decrypt that message what GitHub would've sent me is usually some code

104
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,510
which I have to send back to them to let them know OK you know intended recipient was an actual recipient

105
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,010
and then they'll also send me a key they're gonna send me a symmetric key.

106
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,720
It's this symmetric key we'll both be able to encrypt and decrypt.

107
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,750
So we're gonna establish communication with asymmetric encryption public private key It's asymmetric

108
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,710
is the public key and the private key are different.

109
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,170
We're gonna establish communication with that.

110
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:24,740
And then once communication is established we're going to switch to symmetric key and a symmetric key

111
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,780
is going to be able to both encrypt and decrypt because you could only encrypt with the public key you

112
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,120
can't decrypt and you could only decrypt with the private key when we have symmetric.

113
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,490
We're going to be able to both encrypt and decrypt but only get hub and myself will have these keys

114
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,760
and the passing of that key was passed securely through encryption so nobody else could have intercepted

115
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:46,900
it.

116
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,100
Because we use asymmetric to pass that key and a code phrase.

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,050
And then I decrypted that the public encryption sent me the key in private encrypted private key decrypted

118
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,990
it and now we have what was decrypted what GitHub sent me is that symmetric key where we both have the

119
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,830
same key.

120
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,660
So now I can encrypt something to get hub send it back to get hub and we're being we're able to communicate

121
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:15,080
and secure encrypted fashion using cryptography encoding our messages and then decoding them when they

122
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,890
receive and nobody else can encrypt or decrypt encode or decode those messages because nobody else has

123
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,700
the same key.

124
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,060
There's only two of them.

125
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,380
And so that's kind of I think interesting and not all that widely known about asymmetric and symmetric

126
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,690
encryption asymmetric encryption is public private key and then symmetric encryption I guess maybe you

127
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,850
call private private key.

128
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,980
There's a saying shared secrets shared secret.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,610
So that's my understanding of how that process works.

130
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,680
Do you have anything to add to that.

131
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,700
No.

132
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,200
Did that sound accurate.

133
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,460
Yeah.

134
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:49,860
All right.

135
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,170
For the most understandable.

136
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,520
Good.

137
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,820
So.

138
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,350
So now that we have that that set up we're gonna create a repo for this course.

139
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm going to go to my profile.

140
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,410
I would also like to point out if you just search GitHub SS h the very first result you will get is

141
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:13,640
a guide for SS H including like how would you create a new stage key if you go to any of those it will

142
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,710
have tabs for whatever operating system you're on which will tell you the command for that operating

143
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,410
system which is both the same.

144
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,580
Yeah.

145
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,590
And if you're on Windows it's because it's still a safe kitchen.

146
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,570
It's just might be saved in a different location.

147
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,950
OK.

148
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,600
OK.

149
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,450
I thought it was much more complicated.

150
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,740
Yeah well installing a safe kitchen is a little more complicated but the command itself is the same

151
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,460
command across.

152
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,660
And if you have the emulator on windows where you could do Shell bash terminal commands you could just

153
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,150
use the Mac I put there.

154
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,000
So now we're gonna create a new repo for this course and to do that in and click new repository.

155
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,960
I think I'll save this for the next video.

156
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,630
I'd like to try to keep these videos short.

157
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:03,450
We're already coming up on LIVE minutes has had some good stuff in here about encryption and so all

158
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,540
understanding SS age is what I'll call this video and the next one will create or get a repo.

159
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,010
See you next video.
