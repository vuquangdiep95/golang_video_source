1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,360
OK.

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,340
So you could see here in our course outline just keep you on point.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,280
So you're tracking what we're learning where we're learning it.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:12,600
We just went through understanding SS H encryption working in Windows on the terminal which is also

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:24,380
called Bash which is also called Shell and as opposed to command prompt prompt or CMT or DOS prompt.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,190
I've heard it called all those things.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,310
Yeah.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:34,620
Windows also has power shown imitates but it's basically it's a superset it seems the power show.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:34,890
All right.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,460
So now we're going to create our get repo for this course and we'll clone it.

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:45,090
So I'm going to go to get hub click new repository it's going to bring me to this screen.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,640
I'm going to name my repository.

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,320
So I'm going to call this go laying project and going project.

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,250
I think that's good.

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,450
Going project.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,730
Yeah.

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,030
Yeah that's fine.

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,200
And I'm not going now to get ignore anything like that I'm going to create the repository so click Create

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,080
repository.

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,640
And now this is created quick setup if you've done this kind of thing before.

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,770
I have SSA reached.

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,980
Yes I want to make sure I've got SSA H.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,860
I'm going to copy all of that man.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,610
See.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,210
And then go to my terminal and somewhere in my terminal I think I'll put mine in and we're going to

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,640
get into modules because modules is new.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:33,840
And so as modules are is new we wanted to provide you know some teaching on that so that you can use

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,040
modules will be using go modules in this course if you don't know.

29
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,830
That is great.

30
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,020
We're going to teach in a second.

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,960
But what that means is the old way and go creating a workspace was that you actually had to go workspace.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,820
There was a go path environment variables set to your go workspace inside your go workspace he had a

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,430
source been in package folder inside the source folder usually had some sort of name spacing that would

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,430
separate my code from somebody else's code and then namespace and usually when domain user name some

35
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,550
sort of repos something along those lines and and so insofar as it might be source get hub dot com my

36
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,590
username goes to 11 and then forward slash the repo name is where I'd create the repository but now

37
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,880
I could create I could create folders where I work on go projects anywhere on my computer and we just

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,130
have to create go modules to work in that and so we'll cover how to do that in a second but the point

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,850
of this is all that I could do is on the point of this is all to say that I could put my repo wherever

40
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:39,390
I want on my computer it no longer has to be in that go workspace defined by the go path if you have

41
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,480
legacy projects go pass still works but go modules you can put it anywhere so I'm just going to go to

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,230
documents and in documents I'm going to create this project.

43
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,990
So we're just going to do get clone and I guess before I do that I'll just l s kind of so I could see

44
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,620
what's in there and then we'll see how things have changed and so I'll do it.

45
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,700
S L.A. and that's it's in there and I'm going to do my get clone and clone this project that you are

46
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,840
all a copy and so that's coming down and it's going project get and says you've cloned it into your

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,480
repository and if I do my SLA now I've got going project right there.

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:25,550
So if I go into that C.D. going project and I create a file test start t t and I edit that file opening

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,630
the editor and just text whatever its name spelled right control X to save it yes save it to that and

50
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,670
exit.

51
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,320
And now if I do get status right I've got that test.

52
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,630
I'm just making sure that I actually switched in the building project LSA L.A. I've got my get folder

53
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:51,320
I've got to text files I don't know why to create it seems like when the test wins text test and text.

54
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,390
All right so I'm going to get rid of test.

55
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,590
There we go.

56
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,070
And thank you.

57
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,360
That's where pair programming is awesome.

58
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:08,970
And now I'm going to do a get add Dash I saw and get commit dash first commit test file and then get

59
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,260
push.

60
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,170
And so I should see this show up over on my repo now.

61
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,480
So if I come back to my repo and just hit this it's gonna refresh and now everything's connected in

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,850
my files getting pushed up.

63
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,610
So it's good.

64
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,520
And that's establishing a repo.

65
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,930
This will be the repo for the course.

66
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,280
So if you wanted to add to this or first of all you probably want to clone it down your machine.

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,870
So you have all the code by the time you clone it there's going to be a lot of code in there we're just

68
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,200
getting started and.

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,280
And then if you want to add to this repo or if you even want to contribute to the course in a larger

70
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:53,510
way by what do they call it being an administrator of a repo at length that 0 collaborator a collaborator

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,930
Lord of War.

72
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,930
Seth a jet I have this repo whatever you want to call it if you want to be somebody who else review

73
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:09,150
pull requests and accept those we're totally open to that because life gets busy but if you know you

74
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,320
have time you want to be able to sort of contribute to community.

75
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,290
That's awesome.

76
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,120
Or if you want to make pull requests like oh here's another thing or contribute another example another

77
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,230
file like here's another way to do it for everybody in the class.

78
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,820
Take a look at this way.

79
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,260
Feel free to add to this repost that pull requests and we're totally going to monitor that as much as

80
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,120
we can and we welcome additional help if anybody else wants to contribute to the monitoring of that.

81
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,700
So that's all I have to say about creating the repo and the next video we're gonna jump on branches

82
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:46,770
but I've been doing all the talk and just kind of get things warmed up get Daniel warmed up and in the

83
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,700
next video we'll jump into looking at branches so that we cover that.

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,570
That's never been covered in my classes because I want to make sure that's covered you have anything

85
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,360
you want and know.

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,890
All right sweet see in the next video.
