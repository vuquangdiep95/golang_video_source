00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,270
Here's hands on Exercise number three and sorry about that noise in the background.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,100
You can hear that we're running short on time but we want to get these done for hands on Exercise number

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:16,140
three from version three point one I know of our CIA quote use the function glass from Version 2.0 1.0

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,270
of our CIO quote use the function.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:24,930
OK and so this hands on exercises just so that you can practice using functions from different major

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,240
branches or different major versions.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
So go ahead and pause this video.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,250
Go do this hands on exercise when you're all done.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,930
Come on back now y'all and we'll show you our solution.

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,680
We're going to do right now.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,700
So in the previous.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,790
Hands on exercise we were already using version o three point one point zero.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,550
And so I've got that three right here and I'm using glass three and now I need to do a version two point

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:01:00,480
one point oh and there is a command up here where we can list all of the versions of package and I'm

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,920
just looking for that command in our list yet.

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,110
I don't think that's to our short list it was but we'll find it here in just one second.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,270
It was something like go list dash and dash version.

18
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,360
It's in the module.

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,650
Erica remember it was on it.

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:19,860
No

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,390
and this is a package name.

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:38,640
Yeah

23
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,780
check it out.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,740
OK.

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,290
So we just found that code it's go list dash M versions and then the package name so I'm going to use

26
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,770
that code here.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,590
Go list dash versions.

28
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,500
Let's have flag.

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:11,810
Yes versions and then the package name which is or C I O quote.

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,250
And so here are the versions of those packages and the ones that I need for this hands on exercise are

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,670
two point one zero.

32
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:34,260
So I've got version 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 because I can also do forward slash v 2 and I could also do need

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,740
to be lowercase city and pretty sure I could also do v 2 and I can also do the three.

34
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:49,290
So there are versions and I would need to point 0 point 1 so I'm going to come back to my code and add

35
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,690
my import and I'll be Version 2 and 0.

36
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:04,830
Better yet gonna go get go get control C.

37
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:21,880
Go get R A C dot dot I O Ford slash quote forward slash V to at B to dot was a e to dot 1.0.

38
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,810
Is that right.

39
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,050
No.

40
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,370
I think it's 2 to 1 but it's also the latest version c do we even need to add sine because it's also

41
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,840
it's also the latest version for me to read too.

42
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,900
Oh all right I got that next step right here

43
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,030
2 0 1.

44
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,130
Sorry if that caused you confusion on years hopefully you figured it out and I'm going to try with that

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,480
because that should be the same as later.

46
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,120
Yep.

47
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:52,860
And so now if I go look at my mod I should have 2 0 1.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,880
Yes.

49
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,540
And there's my import.

50
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,640
And so I could grab that and just add this import in here.

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,450
Or it just easier to duplicate this line go.

52
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:14,820
And now I'm ready to duplicate this line and I need to use from quote and I need an alias.

53
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:23,890
This quote V2 alias that and this will be quote V2 since they have the same package name and the function

54
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:30,800
that I'm going to use is what popped up village to

55
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:41,420
go now to run it and see what happens and my still on a temp exercise 0 1 yet.

56
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,250
Now let's go run main and the program is too slow.

57
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:55,770
Must have a loop and then I'm going to go list dash them all and then go to I.T. just go mod tidy and

58
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,210
I don't think that's going to change anything.

59
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,810
2 3 1 2 3 1 yet saw the same.

60
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,070
All right.

61
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,300
So that's our solution for this.

62
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,220
Hands on exercise the next hands on exercise is gonna be awesome.
