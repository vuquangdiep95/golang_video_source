1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,690
That's a really powerful skill that we just acquired like understanding dependency management package

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,190
management having package management.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,910
That's not going to go ghost on you.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,320
Right.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,080
Like with NPM.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,700
You were like I don't know that code used to be there.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,540
The guy turned off his computer it's gone.

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,940
And like half of the universe stops working for an hour.

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,490
Because they have the module Mir which is a proxy and that proxy is storing everything and by the way

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,310
if you don't want stuff stored there you've got to go private variable which you could set for modules

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:41,850
that you create and then use go modules instead of your go path the old way the workspace then package

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,030
source folder right in the name spacing under source.

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,260
We learned about name spacing you now use modules instead of that and with modules anywhere on your

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,360
computer you just say hey this is a module and you set the namespace.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,050
You set the namespace so that namespace is whatever you want it to be.

16
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,500
I use that goofy you to Mickey Mouse Donald Duck and Daphne or whatever it was or you know it's best

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,070
to connect it was something on the web so that we're if you want other people to access your code so

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,370
that when your code is up there you know it's stored or just so that you know where it's stored.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,250
If it's private write your modules connected at this storage location so domain and then whatever else.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,660
And so we learn that and we also learn how to create a module that could be access and used by you or

21
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:40,470
anybody and and connecting that to get hub and then pushing it up there and adding a version so that

22
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,650
you can now increment your versions and we learned about versioning major minor in Patch.

23
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,570
And so how you add those numbers and where and when you would major breaks backwards compatibility minor

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,240
does not you know it's backwards compatible and patches backwards compatible.

25
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:02,670
What else do we learn in that some some good stuff how to eat how to upgrade from you can have multiple

26
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,800
versions of a packet of a module at the same time so incremental upgrades

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,200
and what else.

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,380
Anything else.

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,220
In the end all the various tag the tag stuff text that's the useful even if you're not intending it

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,850
to be used by others just as kind of a this is a you would tag a version that you consider working so

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,720
you may have like three commits before you put it another tag because your code was not fully functional

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,480
during those other two minutes in the middle and then the third version.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,730
Third mate Nico it's all functional out attack.

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,560
There is now version one point two.

35
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,730
All right Suzanne good stuff.

36
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,890
I hope you enjoyed that and we're gonna sit back and reflect over the weekend on what to teach you next.

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,480
I know that curl is something that is potentially on our horizon as well as some of the items down here

38
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,700
context package continuous integration build pipeline.

39
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,390
I don't know if that's going to fit into this.

40
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,500
What we're doing.

41
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,430
You know just a note there to talk about documentation and that's not so much going to fit in but interfaces

42
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:20,160
and middleware and testing and benchmarking and then also creating some sort of monolithic application

43
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,680
but this entire process up to this point has kind of surprised me it took longer than I thought.

44
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:32,850
So this might end up being a course in and of itself pretty close just like some damn fundamental skills

45
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,560
and we might do the monolith course in another one because in the past my courses have all been really

46
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,780
long and so I'm trying to break those up into the six to eight hour range so we'll edit this all up

47
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,880
and we'll see where we are at.

48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,690
And and then we might have a second course instead of making this one monolithic course after that.

49
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,130
All right.

50
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,180
You have anything you want to say or add before we 442 we did pretty good we got 18 minutes left before

51
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,140
we head out for the weekend.

52
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,680
Anything else you want to add any personal anecdotes.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,030
So it's just personal anecdotes from this point for now.

54
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,140
No.

55
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,480
Let me see if I have any personal anecdotes so I was thinking of.

56
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:20,410
I had one idea for software in the middle of night last night and in business there is this thing called

57
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:26,130
the Hawthorne effect I think that's what it's called Hawthorne effect Yeah.

58
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,220
Ricky and they study type of reactive in which individuals modify an aspect to their behavior in response

59
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,660
to the awareness that being observed and so they study back in the day people on the factory floor it

60
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,420
scientists come in academics and they said we're gonna study how you all are working and how the level

61
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,630
light in the factory affects your performance.

62
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,200
And so they turned up the light they made it really bright and productivity went up and they said that's

63
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,250
interesting.

64
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,560
And then they turned down the light and they made it darker than it was normally.

65
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,640
And productivity went up even higher and they're confused.

66
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,650
And then what they realized was the light had nothing to do with it.

67
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,500
Well they're as bright or dim.

68
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,850
And what mattered was whether or not the individuals were being observed.

69
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,100
And so with the Hawthorne effect and also with this idea of reflection.

70
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,750
So if we reflect upon who we are and what we're doing at work I had an idea for like some software that

71
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,260
would allow employees to sort of like get hub log what they do every day.

72
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,480
And so that would track there'd be a system that would track kind of like before you went to lunch.

73
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,790
Here's what I did from 8:00 to noon.

74
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,700
And then after you came back you know before he left for the day.

75
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,010
Here's what I did from 1 to 5 met and made these contacts I have these leads here are the phone numbers

76
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,060
the emails had a conversation with this person to a log all of your activity.

77
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,990
So it's basically like get hub but for people who are in sales or people who are you know I don't know

78
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,790
what else is there engineering and sales

79
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,260
you know whatever your position is you'd be logging your activity for the day and then you could run

80
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,530
a email against all of that to try to find efficiencies.

81
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,820
And also most importantly I could try to bring cohesion to the organization.

82
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,810
So the organization would know what it knows more effectively know what it knows.

83
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,690
And because you'd see who's doing what.

84
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:24,440
But then also people would feel like whatever they're doing there they're not having a quarterly evaluation

85
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,840
and not having an annual or every in academia I get evaluated every three years that's it.

86
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,390
Right.

87
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,780
It's like every four hours somebody might be looking their people up above in the machine learning to

88
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,750
be looking at what they've done over the last four hours.

89
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,500
And so with that sense of OK I got to be on point.

90
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,030
It could lead to increased productivity might just make everybody stressed out at work.

91
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:54,240
You know the guy who's studied efficiency see I'm actually going to google that.

92
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,780
The big guy who's studied efficiency

93
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,100
Frank Buck is crazy idea that Google would bring that up.

94
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,900
Frank Buck American author and pioneer time motion study right father and central figure I don't know

95
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,940
what Cheaper By The Dozen is but he was an efficiency expert.

96
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,740
I wonder if there's the shovel story in here.

97
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:24,090
So time efficient see shovels story.

98
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,100
Let's see.

99
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,300
Frederick Winslow Taylor.

100
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,560
That's it.

101
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,830
So wasn't this guy is Frederick Winslow Taylor.

102
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,020
So this guy Frederick Winslow Taylor studied how can people be more efficient.

103
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:46,080
And he would time them with a stopwatch and he just stressed everybody out and and and so he did this

104
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,480
with all of his kids and and and I think this is true.

105
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,850
Kids suicide.

106
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,970
All these kids killed themselves.

107
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,850
They're like this is too intense.

108
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,310
There were a decade after that.

109
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,690
I don't.

110
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:09,090
So that might just be that might be what do they call those cultural myths.

111
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,020
We're really onto a personal anecdote.

112
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,100
What do they call those cultural myths there.

113
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,160
There is a movie you probably know.

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,440
What is it cultural Miss.

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:23,940
I don't know.

116
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,420
So anyhow maybe it's just one of those cultural myths and it's not actually true.

117
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,880
All right.

118
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,160
A little bit of a personal anecdote and just some interesting information about efficiency but that

119
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:40,970
was the idea that came to me last night for some software could be interesting might be a light bill.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,410
See you in the next video.
