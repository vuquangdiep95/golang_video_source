1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:00,900
All right.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,550
So now we're down to hands on exercises and this is Ninja level to Ninja level to number two.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:08,910
There we go.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,910
Ninja Level 2 and I'm super excited for these hands on exercises.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,930
It is 4 0 7 on Friday we've got four hands on exercises for you here and I think they're going to be

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,150
really cool and really fun.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,230
And our goal is to get through these forehands on exercises introducing them to you and then also showing

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,910
you the solution to them before 5 o'clock because that's when like you know we're done.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,130
So we've been here doing this for quite a bit today.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,550
Yeah.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,810
Been a good time and there's been a lot of intricate detail in the module stuff but now I think in using

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:48,630
it you're going to find that you're very conversant with it and that it's actually not you know the

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,140
theory there's a lot theory there but in practice it's pretty simple.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,080
So for this first hands up Yeah I mean you want to add just motivational inspirational do good to others

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:07,650
be kind have good integrity and then for this hands on exercise we want you to create a go module import

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,540
Ah I see I quote use glass from our C I O forward slash quote run your program look at your go module

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,570
what version of RL CIO quote are you using.

18
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,840
Do you have any indirect dependencies and then list out all your dependencies to see if you have any

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,680
indirect ones I put the command there for you and then just look at your go some.

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,190
So pauses video go do that hands on exercise when you're all done.

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,620
Now y'all come on back on pause the video and we'll show you our solution which we're gonna do right

22
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,390
now.

23
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,770
Do you want to do it or do you want me to do it.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,540
I think you better do.

25
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,630
Given I just lost connection again Oh you lost connection again.

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,390
OK so for this one my first thought would be to like I need to be in some other space and I don't need

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,680
this to be on github.

28
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,810
I'm just kind of thinking through my process so I don't need to create a repo because I'm just going

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,930
to get rid of this at the same time I don't want to do it in this folder right here.

30
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,080
That always kind of freaks me out when I bring this is our screen recording software I'm like whoa.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,140
Inception reality within reality.

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,240
I don't want to do it in here.

33
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:19,380
Where do you have go module so I'm just gonna go to you know my terminal and go back to my home folder

34
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:29,070
and then just make it door and call it temp exercise 0 1 and and then I'm going to open up that so I

35
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:39,210
could do code dot and it opened up that your Holder opened up my home folder don't allow don't allow.

36
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:45,380
I think that's going to keep coming back up in a close that I want to switch into my directory so seedy

37
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:51,110
into I get excited and I go too fast and forget steps and now I'm going to do code dot and that's going

38
00:02:51,110 --> 00:03:00,290
to open up my my editor and I'm switching from a go land which I loved but at our school people are

39
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:07,130
moving to the free option so here I go to B.S. codes and still learn B.S. code and so inside here I'm

40
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,870
going to create a folder and click on that and they'll just be.

41
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,250
Actually I don't need a folder I could just do my code right here and I need main go.

42
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:28,980
And this is package Main and func main and I want to use for this I want to use from our CIO quote use

43
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,780
glass and so I need to go find our CIO quote and here's the import some import that's going to grab

44
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:44,670
that and drop this and as an import and save this and when it saved it just went away.

45
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,270
So I'm not using anything from there.

46
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,360
And I also need my go module file.

47
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:55,050
So in this route I'm in that route right there from my thing I'm going to go mod a net and then I need

48
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,680
some sort of namespace.

49
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,640
And since this is just a throw away my namespace is going to be Mickey Mouse for it slash Donald Duck

50
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,380
forward slash

51
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,480
he could just do this to Daphne.

52
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,240
There you go.

53
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,940
And so that's my new go modules in that namespace.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,120
And and now I'm going to import that package and not save it.

55
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:32,270
And from quote I'm gonna use glass and I just want to print that front up front line.

56
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:39,750
Quote glass and then I'm gonna save it and it brought all that in and I'm gonna run it go round and

57
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,220
go and I can eat glass and it doesn't hurt me.

58
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,320
That's not true.

59
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:51,780
I don't it would hurt me and I don't eat it but it is a funny function in that quote in that package.

60
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:58,590
And so now if I look at my go mod I could see that I'm requiring version one point five point two are

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,920
a C I O quote If I look at my go sum I could kind of come in here and see.

62
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,640
I could see those hashes not I kind of but I can't for reals for reals.

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,970
I could see those different hashes in there and if I want to look at my indirect dependencies as well

64
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:22,340
as my direct dependencies go list dash em all and I could see both my indirect and direct dependency

65
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,050
so there's my direct dependency.

66
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,570
Here's indirect dependency and here's an indirect dependency.

67
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,540
And then here is my namespace.

68
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,370
That's the word that comes to me would use that word.

69
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,890
Then I'd go module and module name for that thing.

70
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,590
So that's hands on exercise no one would see if I got it all run your program look it go mod you have

71
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,720
any indirect dependencies.

72
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,110
Yes.

73
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,630
And look it goes on so as my solution for hands on exercise number one.
