1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:00,690
All right.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,140
For this next hands on exercise you're gonna create one repo.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:13,110
Create a package add it go modules to it and then create another repo and get and or doesn't need to

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,350
be on.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,120
Get the second one doesn't need second one doesn't need to be but the first one does go get it and then

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,080
your second one is you're going to use the package you created in the first one.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:32,140
And so you know create create and create a new create a new go module new project with a go module new

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,490
project with a go module.

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,430
This can be on your computer or on.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,660
Also if you want so if you want it on github there it is and you're going to add your go module.

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,060
That's obvious and then the first one from your get hub report number one quotes.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,740
Use the function faves.

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,020
Let's just not do it on get out.

14
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,000
That's gonna be too much.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,460
A great new project.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,810
This is does not need to be on

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,200
this community computer and does not need to be on github.

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,460
Use function faves string and add I get tagged version 1 0 run your code and we're going to take this

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,730
out and we aren't going to have a tag.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,740
Well well it doesn't matter right.

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,380
Yeah yeah.

22
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,170
Guess we're seeing that in the previous one.

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,420
All right.

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,270
So there's your hands on exercise clauses video to do that.

25
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,350
Hands on exercise when you're all done.

26
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,350
Come on back and you'll see our solution.

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,410
I'm gonna pass this laptop to Daniel.

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,040
We've got like seven minutes to do it.

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,280
I think we can do it.

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,570
Can we hold yours.

31
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:48,840
Let's do the laptop swap because his is a I don't know what's going on that but I think it's having

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,650
it mostly just issues with the Google Drive.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,510
It's it's got everything else seems to be working.

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,540
The hardest thing about this is going to be you're now on Mac.

35
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,440
You're gonna be like Where are the keys for the most part.

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,640
Yeah.

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,620
So I'll do it man.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,390
It's my get hub and everything.

39
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,840
Yeah maybe I'll pass it to you for your second one.

40
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,180
All right.

41
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:13,240
So I'm going to create and you get every post so I'm gonna go to get hub and create a new Reaper and

42
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,030
this report is gonna be called what's it called the repository.

43
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:28,050
And it's going to be called quote and create repository and then I'm going to clone this with S AS H.

44
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:39,630
So copy all that and come back here and I'm gonna CB and then get clone there and so cloned and then

45
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:50,960
l SLA and C.D. and quotes and LSD stash L.A. and I get mod and net and then I'm going to need my Go

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,830
Go modern that I'm going to need my.

47
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,650
Let's close the door.

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,870
The other doors open and go modern.

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,130
And I'm gonna need.

50
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:17,900
Get hub dot com forward slash goes to eleven goes to eleven I'm not got Wow pair programming is awesome

51
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:26,540
and and then I'm going to add in this one is called quotes.

52
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,000
So that looks good.

53
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,750
So now I do my all SLA and I've got that there and I'm gonna open this so I can close this one.

54
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:48,170
I got this one and here I'm gonna do code and I open that and I'm going to create a new file and this

55
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:59,600
is going to be I guess this could be called anything and and then I'm gonna have a package quotes in

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,730
here and I'm gonna have a funk and it's gonna be called favorites.

57
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,600
Is that the name of a famous faves.

58
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,150
And I wanted to be exported right.

59
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,560
Yeah.

60
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:17,170
So it needs to be that it can return a slice of string otherwise it won't be available to people.

61
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:26,680
If it was an export it's I need to update our assignment to have faves exported and faves.

62
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,030
And now I'm going to create a slice.

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,530
So I'm going to have my slice of quotes will be equal to and I'll use a composite literal strings.

64
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,160
And then I'm gonna put some quotes in here and I'm just gonna go find some quotes.

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,290
So Rumi quotes Rumi as a poet.

66
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,980
Here are a couple of Rumi quotes.

67
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,340
They look pretty good.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,180
And I'm gonna grab those and I want to quickly sort of karma quotes and commas.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,750
Oh we're running out of time okay.

70
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,340
So this is gotta be fast.

71
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:12,870
And so I'm going to do that and I need to quickly add.

72
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:20,360
Well I've posted multiple cursor selection so we'll go to keyboard.

73
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,370
Where's my help.

74
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:30,560
Interactive keyboard shortcut reference and multiple cursor and multiple cursor is insert cursor is

75
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,220
was that option click.

76
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,300
I don't know the Mac symbols first option option click

77
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,000
on Big Baby come on baby

78
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:56,410
I'll put quotes and then we'll go down here and we'll get rid of that and we'll put quotes here and

79
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:04,930
here and here and here and here and here and here and you're here let's be quotes comma and and then

80
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:12,900
I just think we need something over this and I'll be a quote comma and so that should be OK.

81
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,080
And now I'm going to return that

82
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:27,970
and so I'm returning my slice of strings and it's giving me a don't don't return the variable access.

83
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,570
I'll just return the whole thing.

84
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,330
Thank you Erica.

85
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,610
All right.

86
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,510
So that's quotes and this is a little bit of a bigger hands on project.

87
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,300
So the first one I got.

88
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,340
This created GitHub repo your repo added go module add a function add to get tag version want that that

89
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,700
minor version 1 so I'm gonna do get tagged so you must have a permit to tag.

90
00:06:52,830 --> 00:07:06,160
OK so get add Shay get commit ads fave quotes and not get tag and it's going to be version quotes around

91
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,400
tag doesn't not required zero dot one zero.

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,890
Right.

93
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:19,830
And then get push and we're gonna come look at this repo and let's see if it's up there.

94
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,820
And so far so good.

95
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,720
And releases

96
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,820
Oh man was my internet.

97
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,070
Yeah I just lost everything all Internet myself.

98
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,730
Come on.

99
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,830
There aren't any releases here because you do not push the tech.

100
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,690
Oh Kit push dash hashtags right.

101
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,470
Yes.

102
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,190
There we go good reminder

103
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,900
now we've got a release.

104
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,100
And so now I'm going to use this right there.

105
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:05,240
Copy that and I'm gonna go create yet one more directory and I already have one which is print working

106
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,450
directory.

107
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,300
I'm here.

108
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:13,940
I'm gonna come up a level and less and I'm gonna see into what is the one I just did before this temp

109
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,960
exercise when Tip exercise 1.

110
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,960
Thank you.

111
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:22,710
And and then I'm gonna open that one so we'll close this one.

112
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,110
How much time we got two minutes.

113
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,780
One minute.

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,460
We got one minute and it's too much pressure starting.

115
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,220
All right.

116
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,260
Now we have all the time in the world.

117
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,620
All right.

118
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,360
But that is kind of fun having the pressure.

119
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,240
So now we're going to code dot dot and open that up.

120
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,370
And in here I can change all of this.

121
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:53,370
I want to use my code and so I'm going to import that from

122
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,580
here and then I'm going with HP yes.

123
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,850
Thank you.

124
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm gonna use quotes uh for index value call an equal range.

125
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,490
Quotes

126
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:26,470
dot faves and I'm gonna find out print line and we'll do print index and the value of the quote to your

127
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,820
area there is beats function faves.

128
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,300
There you go and you must put quotes

129
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,110
and I think that all looks good.

130
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,500
We look at our go mine.

131
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,870
I've got that one.

132
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,450
If I do my go my tiny that's now being cleaned up.

133
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
And I'm going to do.

134
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,120
Go on me and go

135
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,210
do that.

136
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,700
Let's see if we got anything else.

137
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:15,710
We need to do it use the uh the correct version to if you look at the Go mod and go some.

138
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,710
You can see the go mine that is actually using the 0 the version number is correct.

139
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,100
With these 0 1 0.

140
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,010
That's super cool and

141
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,070
just curious as you could see that.

142
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,560
All right.

143
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,520
That's hands on Exercise number four.

144
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,410
I hope you enjoyed it.

145
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,390
I totally enjoyed it.
