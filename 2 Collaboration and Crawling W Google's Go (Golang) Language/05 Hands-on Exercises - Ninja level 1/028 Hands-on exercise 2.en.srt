00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,450
Welcome to hands on Exercise number two in this hands on exercise you'll emerge from the branch right.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,700
You're going to create a branch you're gonna merge from on your fork you're gonna create a branch off

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,880
of master and you're going to merge from that branch off of master to master on the repo from which

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,120
you fought so at your fork of this repo.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,380
Do the following.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,800
Create a branch titled My humble switch to the branch in the folder 0 2 hands on exercises 0 2 humble

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,200
create a file called Your get hub user name dash humble the text in the file share what being humble

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,610
means to you.

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,810
Stage I know it's an interesting question and stage this file commit this file provide a descriptive

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:53,190
commit message push this file to your fork create a pull request to branch master on this repo right.

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,830
So that's that's what you're going to do it's just going to be creating a pull request from a fork other

12
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:04,650
than master off of or from a branch other than master off of your fork and just to give you a little

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:13,710
example of what that question means to be humble and let's be humble mean to you I've included goes

14
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,620
to Levin humble text already so you could take a look at that and you could read you know what that

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,780
what my response was to that question and so go ahead and pause this video.

16
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,750
Do your hands on exercise and when you're all done.

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,960
Come on back now y'all and we'll show you our solution to this.

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,300
Hands on exercise which we're gonna do right now you want to go first.

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,590
Sure.

20
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,020
All right you got one in there.

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,480
Yeah.

22
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,300
Let me show you.

23
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,010
This is what do you have an answer that question or do you want me to share what I said somewhere.

24
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,330
All right go for it let's see it.

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,290
Yeah yeah.

26
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:56,040
So I'm in my my repo my fork and I don't actually need to be on on there on the web on it but I just

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:05,330
want to make sure I am in case I need to make another pull request and so I go I can open up the.

28
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:14,840
Here is the fold the folder go up and over to humble and here is the one solution already.

29
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,860
And so I can create new new file

30
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:38,330
dash humbles that description or Florida's humble but yeah but I uh I guess yeah it's fine either way

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,350
but that's the way I wrote it

32
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,550
awesome.

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,080
I love the smooth flow my my trackpad ran out of space so I just had blood flow

34
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:19,330
to me being humble means driving.

35
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,930
There's my answer.

36
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,000
Now status it.

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,340
Oh

38
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,070
that's a warning on Windows has a different way of doing new lines than Linux and Mac.

39
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,350
So it's just a warning that github will correct this.

40
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,500
The Linux version as it commits.

41
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,420
Yeah ignorable CRL F stands for carriage return like feed and carriage return comes from the days of

42
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,400
typewriters where you had this carriage which would go back and forth which move the paper so the keys

43
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,190
would type on it.

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,050
So a carriage return was when it got over here I went King all the way back and fed the line.

45
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,710
So Windows does carriage return line feet at the end and on PASOK systems Linux and Mac they just do

46
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,820
line feed is that right.

47
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,360
Yeah.

48
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:18,220
The symbols which kids symbolize the symbols which symbolize the end of the line for Windows CRL half

49
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,420
carriage return lying feet and for Mac it posits Unix like

50
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:36,250
so had I commit and push to my repository except I made a mistake.

51
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,260
The goal of this exercise was not to put it master.

52
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:53,550
So there is a solution to this still I can create my branch of this point.

53
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,370
So now I mean this in my branch and it can push from here.

54
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:14,360
It's going to repeat the error message again for the first time pushing it so I can push now.

55
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,560
There's nothing on that branch yet right.

56
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,650
Just push the branch.

57
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,050
So but but this but this branch got pulled off a master with my command that I beat on nails dragged

58
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,150
down on it.

59
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:36,090
So so now both my master and my branch here both have that file selected and I did push to master so

60
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,670
both have that but I am now on this branch set up with that file.

61
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,290
Now you can emerge from that branch.

62
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:43,710
Yes.

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,510
So.

64
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,190
Interesting you see that.

65
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,190
So my mistake.

66
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:58,140
Most things in get you can fix until you've pushed once you've pushed.

67
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,370
There are still ways to force changes to happen but it's not.

68
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,240
It's really really difficult to edit it and just undo stuff.

69
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,940
Once you here she had a gun once you shot a gun that you shot that gun.

70
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,140
Exactly.

71
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,930
So.

72
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,290
So before you've pushed you can do at and you can edit your local get and undo a comment but until this

73
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,780
was you pushed all you can do is they could commit that does the opposite of what you've already done

74
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:34,380
and you still have that your history so that I can make a pull request and I want to go from my branch

75
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:43,990
humble to muster that adds the file create a pull request here and did my

76
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,350
that

77
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,450
means you know I think it was

78
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,600
I wanted to

79
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,830
I think this is a really cool example for your humble exercise you're like hey I made a mistake let's

80
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,760
fix it.

81
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,140
It's very humble of you and now you're going to accept it.

82
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,420
So and then as as me I am allowed to accept my own request.

83
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,780
So as we.

84
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,840
Awesome nice solution.
