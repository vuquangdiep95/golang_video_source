1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,350
All right.

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,600
Welcome to the hands on exercises ninja Level 1.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:09,800
We call these hands on exercises ninja levels because it's fun and we can't use.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,280
I was a little concerned about using jet level because jet I level maybe Disney might have an issue

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,160
with that.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,350
So we're calling a ninja level one.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:26,280
And by the way just because I mentioned Disney I just want to say hey to all of my Disney jet engineers

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,960
at the Jet I Engineering Academy which is something Disney has not a lot of people know about.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,920
Totally cool the Jedi Engineering Academy.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,930
How sweet is that.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,940
So you might google it or look into it and they look for guest speakers so if you're somebody who's

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,650
in the L.A. area maybe they have other locations and you want to speak at the Jet I engineering academy

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,810
that's like an awesome thing to put on your résumé.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,000
Total tangent sorry.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,660
Try to save personal anecdotes to the end.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,590
These are hands on exercises are going to help you learn more efficiently and effectively which means

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,920
you're going to learn faster and you're going to remember it longer.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,520
You can't.

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,770
Well maybe you can.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,130
I can't I can't just watch the videos and you know retain like I have to actually get my hands dirty

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,600
and go out there and work with it and try it out myself and so that's what these hands on exercises

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,940
are designed for.

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,410
That's one of the things that I think distinguishes the courses that I create we're creating from other

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:29,310
classes because a lot of these online classes is just some voice over screen recording and you're like

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,170
impressed by what that person does anything.

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,700
Wow.

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,120
You know you understand everything why you watch it all but then you get to the end.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,950
You don't really know anything.

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,590
So the hands on exercises is really a difference.

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,320
And so that's from 20 years in academia over 20 years 20 22.

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,170
Coming up on 23 years now working at the university and college level doing the work is really kind

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,650
of having persistence having grit adding those drops to the bucket persistently patiently.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,910
You're bound to succeed doing the work that's doing these hands on exercises.

34
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,100
That's what really helps you learn these skills.

35
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:14,340
So we've put together some awesome hands on exercises here for you to help you solidify and cement everything

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,880
we are going through with get and I'm a little bit sleep deprived because I was up editing the videos

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,870
last night and they're looking great really happy at how they're turning out but so we're gonna go through

38
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,550
these hands on exercises and I really encourage you to do them and to have a good time while you're

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,270
doing them because if you're not having a good time what's the point.

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,050
What's the point.

41
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,500
I've been listening to.

42
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,130
I'll save that personal anecdote for the end of this video.

43
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,340
All right.

44
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,880
A couple of housekeeping items.

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,220
There's two computers Daniel and I each have a computer and so sometimes you see my screen sometimes

46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,410
you see Daniel's screen you probably maybe already figured that out but I realized we hadn't spoken

47
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,960
to that when I was editing the videos last night.

48
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,070
And so I just wanted to make sure that you realize hey sometimes you're seeing his machine sometimes

49
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,710
you're seeing my machine.

50
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,590
And then also we've created some structure to get hub repo.

51
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,790
And if you look at the get hub repo here I have created 0 0 1 learning yet so you probably already saw

52
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,370
that since you're seeing the finished repo as if you went through some time machine.

53
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,490
I wish we could go through that in the court.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,380
No because then I'd be older and I wouldn't have lived it but 0 0 1 learning gets all the code we've

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,330
done up to this point.

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,110
Inside there you'll see those dog bird folders that we were creating.

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,100
And then if you wish to see the repo as it was as we're going through it you can click the commits the

58
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:48,030
the the commit do it show them and you can see here's all the commits and you can go back to any given

59
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,270
commit and you can.

60
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,540
And you can see what the repo looked like right after this occurred.

61
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,380
This is amazing stuff.

62
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,530
It's truly amazing.

63
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,800
Linus Torvalds is a genius.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,590
Hey I'm going to shut this window because yard people just started running yard equipment outside.

65
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:04,890
Hold on.

66
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,150
Sorry for getting you off my chair.

67
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,900
All right.

68
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,130
And then the hands on exercises are going to be in 0 0 2.

69
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,500
You can see there's about humble and purpose.

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,020
So if that doesn't pique your interest you know these are going to be pretty interesting hands on exercises

71
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,010
in a Comp Sci course where it's about humble and purpose.

72
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,840
So we're going to integrate a little humanity with a little bit of our coding and then finally the last

73
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,170
thing I want to do under housekeeping is just share a little bit about the methodology sounds so rigorous

74
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,210
and official the way in which we are kind of thinking about building this course and so part of the

75
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,030
way we're building this course is that I tweeted out to all the people who follow me on Twitter and

76
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,350
I asked.

77
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,120
And whereas that like creating a project based web dev go long course need web dev project I need a

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,260
web dev project to create any ideas you need something built reply below or DME.

79
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,790
And so we asked people you know what do you want to see in this course.

80
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,550
What what would you like to have built.

81
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,450
And there was a ton of responses.

82
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,880
And one of the responses that came back I'm not sure how many times but people wanted to see how to

83
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,580
contribute to open source projects.

84
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,600
And so that's kind of why that that influenced our thinking to include this get stuff right at the beginning.

85
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,250
And so I just wanted to speak speak to that sort of let you know where we're getting ideas some of the

86
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,790
ideas for what we're including in this course.

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,430
All right.

88
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,840
So it's an introduction to this section hands on exercises.

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,810
Ninja Level 1.

90
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,330
And the next video we will do the first hands on exercise and then we'll give you the solution to that.

91
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,250
So we're going to give you the problem.

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,120
You can pause the video.

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,010
Go do the problem and then you'll positive video and you could see our solution.

94
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,740
And so that's we're going to do the next video analogies provide that personal anecdote.

95
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,930
So you just saw here for the coding jump ahead.

96
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,680
I know sometimes I get a you know you just push start and the mouse starts.

97
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,480
So here's a personal anecdote.

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,810
I've been listening to a lot of Anthony Tony Robbins recently.

99
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,750
He has this great book unshakeable.

100
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,880
He spent seven years researching and he's connected to some of the most powerful people on the planet.

101
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,900
So he spent seven years talking with people like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffett and some of the heaviest

102
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,900
hitters the luminaries of investing.

103
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,110
And they built all that research into a book.

104
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,850
Two books and the short book is called unshakable so I've been listening to his book and it's a great

105
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,790
book.

106
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,640
It's really good.

107
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,590
So I don't know what else I want to say about that.

108
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:45,020
I think I was talking about voices and he's he you could hear it in his voice he talks a lot.

109
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,360
All right.

110
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,680
So that's a personal anecdote.

111
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,680
And we will see you in the next.

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,490
Hands on exercise.

113
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,460
Do you have any housekeeping or anything you want to add.

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,170
No.

115
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,420
See you in the next video.
