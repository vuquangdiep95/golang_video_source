1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,210
So this is hands on Exercise number four.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,550
It's the last hands on exercise in the set and are the last of our get hands on exercises for this hands

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,660
on exercises.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:18,150
Clean up your repository on your local machine delete your branches and so delete your branches.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,680
And here's the code to do that.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,460
Just as a reminder to get branch dash D branch name and once we accept your poll request which might

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,830
take who knows maybe a few months and truly hopefully.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,350
Honestly I hope some people in the class volunteer to be collaborators so on the repo we could add you

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,220
as a collaborator and then and then you know you can help bring in these assignments but once that's

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,700
done you can delete your branch on your fork on github and then prune locally and and tell us a little

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:50,850
bit.

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,560
Daniel why.

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:59,350
Why they aren't able to delete their branch on GitHub before we've accepted or merged in their request.

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,100
Because if you delete it on github then the request doesn't know where to pull from to do the merge

15
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,430
so you need to make sure that E.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,800
You need to make sure that the poor request is gone through or been rejected before the branch delete

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,470
it because otherwise I'm not actually sure how GitHub would respond exactly but I'm I'm pretty sure

18
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,990
that if you just delete the branch the pull request will then be cancelled as well because it doesn't

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,870
know where to pull it.

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,620
Maybe that's an experiment for us to run at some point.

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,940
You're kind of curious.

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,290
All right.

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,320
So go do this.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,520
Hands on exercise.

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,260
Pause a video.

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,620
Go do it when you're all done.

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,770
Come on back and we'll show you our solution.

28
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,380
What you're gonna do right now so make sure you've already paused this video.

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,230
Gone gone and done it all right.

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,560
OK you're ready.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,070
Here we go.

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,770
You want to go first for me.

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,710
Sure I've got I've got less to do because I get branch.

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,290
I can see I've got the mask for my purpose.

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,450
I don't have the.

36
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,930
The other one.

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,200
The humble one because I had to eat it my entire fork and read and report it including tweak my local

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,080
branches so I don't actually have the extra branch.

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,710
So for me it's just a we.

40
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,080
My purpose.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,030
I can see many branches just half that.

42
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
All right great.

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:26,060
And for me get branch I've got master my second my purpose I am going to get branch DST see second and

44
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,430
get branch SD.

45
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,260
My purpose in deleting my purpose.

46
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,620
And now if I do get branch I just have master and if I want to see all my branches I've got master origin

47
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,390
HEAD origin master origin EMC second origin upstream master and since my pull requests have already

48
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:56,480
been accepted and merged in skin to get status here and I'm all up to date but just because of voodoo

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,110
computing I'm gonna do a get pull and make sure but now I'll go back to my going project.

50
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:03,770
This is on.

51
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,490
Oh yeah.

52
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:13,280
This is goes to eleven I need my my repositories and I want to go to going project forked from goes

53
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,730
to 11:00 so temp Todd McCloud going project and if I go look at my branches here I've M.S. second and

54
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:28,010
I'll get rid of this one because I don't need it and so again if I do get branch dash a I still have

55
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,190
M.S. second here so this is where I need to prune it and I could go back and grab this prune code I

56
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:42,270
don't know it off the top of my head and I wrote it down here somewhere gimme Jimmy f prune.

57
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,980
There you go.

58
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:51,170
Get remote prune origin we'll use the power of technology to find that and and now pruned my second

59
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,740
I've got upstream match their origin master origin HEAD AND MASTER so I'm all clean.

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,230
All right.

61
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:03,860
So that's our solution for this hands on exercise and that didn't take very long.

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,770
No.

63
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,730
So once you pull requests have been accepted.

64
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:14,430
If you don't need your fork at all anymore you are safe to eat your fork repo.

65
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,600
In this case if you want to keep it that's fine too.

66
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,230
But there's little point in keeping a fork of open source repo.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,340
After all the changes you want to make have been made yet so as you're working through the course you

68
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,890
might want to keep your fork because then you'll have all of the code as it was at the time when you

69
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:39,210
started the course or from whence you last rebase to your fork and and then you could push your code

70
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,230
and keep it.

71
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:47,280
And then any of those branches that you like that you wanted to send over to goes to eleven add in.

72
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,880
So for instance as you're going through the course if I'm just looking for directory structure and I

73
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,660
think this will be the best place to show directory structure.

74
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:05,340
So here's going project 0 2 purpose and so maybe your your like you know you wanted to add some code

75
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,690
for other people to share.

76
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,550
You might create a new folder and say a student code and then maybe create a new folder.

77
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,400
And here would be you know it goes to eleven or whatever year get name whatever you get name was and

78
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,130
so other students who wanted to post some code of different variations with descriptions that could

79
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,870
be beneficial to other students so that might be something you might then say hey I want to send this

80
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,030
over to the goalie goes to eleven goal line project so other students could see it that that makes sense.

81
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,340
Yeah.

82
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,950
Similar uncertain but you know so you can use the fork to do that and branches as you're going through

83
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,470
the class.

84
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,930
Do you want to try that thing where we have just kind of like as a curious thing where we you create

85
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,070
a branch you add a file you submit a merge request and then you delete all of that on your side.

86
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,500
We see what the merge request looks like from goes to 11 or you want me to do it on my sign.

87
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,040
I can do it.

88
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,140
Let's do it projects.

89
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:13,430
Sure I date I am missing your changes fine so I just want to see what happened to it.

90
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,570
If I create a branch so as to

91
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,420
much better.

92
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,170
So yeah I like it.

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,300
Check out the Ashby.

94
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,030
Get your

95
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,080
money.

96
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,180
Yeah.

97
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,590
Just where

98
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,510
maybe that is an opening in a different location close it all down.

99
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,770
Yes I remember now.

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,310
This is this is the goes to love and based going project and I want all that slow climb.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
All right so here is here it is.

102
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,910
If I just create a new file here.

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,470
This is for X here and

104
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,810
X beer instead.

105
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,400
Text

106
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,660
read this

107
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,980
it's

108
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,280
now if I go back year

109
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,750
experiment I want to take a pull request with a

110
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,590
gay experiment to get going.

111
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,420
Project let's create over past

112
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,540
request it's being created.

113
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,810
Now if I go back to mine

114
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,240
I go to branches delete this branch

115
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,290
deleted it.

116
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:41,780
If I come to this one for quite zero it's got no import request that the Clinton supporter put this

117
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,760
you can see it's got this angry red square so it automatically closes it if you delete it because the

118
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,020
code was on your other repo and so it's gone now right.

119
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,990
All right um except that was a good experiment.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,980
That's logical.

121
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,390
Yes.

122
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:56,620
All right.

123
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,170
Hope you've enjoyed this about get.

124
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,690
Hope it's been helpful to you.

125
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,360
Yeah I've certainly enjoyed it.

126
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:08,440
And we look forward to seeing you in the next section where or looking at going into go modules.

127
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,210
We may be we'll switch that up if we talk and we decide something better come next but I'm thinking

128
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,930
go modules is good Max week.

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,380
Yeah.

130
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,080
All right.

131
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:20,650
You have anything else you want to say at last about get life or otherwise.

132
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,410
Forty two forty two.

133
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:23,930
All right.

134
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,060
See in the next section.
