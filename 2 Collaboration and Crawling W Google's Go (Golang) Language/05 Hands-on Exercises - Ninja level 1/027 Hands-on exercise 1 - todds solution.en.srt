1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,960
All right so now I'm going to show you my solution to that first hands on exercise.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,880
And I'm in a dummy account here.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,980
I don't even know if I have SS H set up.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,030
So this is not my goes to 11 account.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,370
This is just some other account I created for this exercise and and to do this first thing I'm going

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,610
to check is I'm going to go into my settings and then in settings we can go to SS H and there's no SS

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:30,510
H key setup so I'm going to bring up my terminal command spacebar brings up spotlight in Mac where you

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,010
could start typing.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,170
You probably already know that.

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,090
Like I said try to find a way between teaching to basic and giving enough information and then I'm going

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:50,790
to s dash L.A. and switch to my home account and then CDM into dot SS H and and then let's dash L.A.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,240
take a look what's in there and I have temp job and that was the example that we created so I'm going

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,990
to cat that cat tab pub and then copy this one and so I'm just going to use a different one than I already

14
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:11,460
have my other get hub which is my eye the RSA pub and I don't think we'd make a difference what I sometimes

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,520
do what I call voodoo computing which is based more upon superstition because nobody knows everything

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,710
we're always operating on the edge of the unknown in computer science like you come up to the threshold

17
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,080
like I don't know anything beyond that point right.

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,510
And and so likes you know like logically if I think it through though it doesn't matter.

19
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,340
This is the public key it will then send me a message which I can decrypt at this right.

20
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,050
Doesn't matter wouldn't matter.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,490
I'm still going to go with Vita computing.

22
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:46,560
And so this is Todd Mach example and add SS H key to computing that's funny and and so now I have an

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,500
SS H and then I'm going to go to goes to eleven and I have a broken screen by the way.

24
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:54,990
I don't know.

25
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,070
Let me it once.

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,260
Yeah right.

27
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,740
Like can you see that like the left side and bottom of my screen is just completely fragmented broken

28
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,140
monitor so I'm going to pick the recording yeah because it comes straight off the video card.

29
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:19,240
So I'm looking for goes to Levin we're going to do it this way it goes to love and get hub and there

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:25,100
I am and then I'm gonna find the repo that I want repositories and we're looking for go long project

31
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,220
there it is and I'm gonna start just because I like like and yeah and I'm gonna watch it.

32
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,480
Not watching watching and now I'm going to fork it no clone or wait let me think it through.

33
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,080
Let's go for yes I want to clone it once it's under my name I don't want to clone it when it's under

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:55,740
it goes to eleven and so now it's here at temp top and cloud we're gonna ignore this temp Todd McCloud

35
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,990
go line project and now I'm going to clone or download with my SS H so I'm going to copy that and if

36
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:09,010
it was HP yes it's a clone with HP yes but I want SS H so I'm getting that and I'm going to go to my

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:17,680
terminal bring that back up and go back to my root directory and then LSI dash L.A. see what's in there

38
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:28,960
and in documents I have my going project which is the one from goes to eleven so I'm going to put this

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,870
just right under my user account different area and going project isn't there so you could see it going

40
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,460
projects not there.

41
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,240
So now I'm gonna do get clone and get that.

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,740
So now it's bringing it down.

43
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,230
And now if I do my L S I could see going project is there.

44
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:54,310
So this is the one connected to the dummy account so I'm going to C.D. into that going project and then

45
00:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,070
take a look at what's in there and then C.D. into the hands on exercise and take a look what's in there

46
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:06,190
and then seeds into about and take a look what's in there and I didn't make it into about I didn't do

47
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,800
my C.D..

48
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,550
There you go take a look what's in there and then I'm going to copy templates I'm going to copy template

49
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:19,690
I'm going to copy that to this current location and it's going to be goes to eleven and I'm going to

50
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:28,930
adjust my terminal here so it's all in one line and not breaking it's gonna be goes to eleven Dot T

51
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,690
X T right.

52
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:39,280
So copy this to the same location call it goes to eleven and now if I do it unless I should see I have

53
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:48,010
goes to eleven and so now I want to edit that so I'm going to use nano to do that here and you're started

54
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:55,460
coding I actually started coding in nineteen eighty four with basic might have been nineteen eighty

55
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:02,360
three is Junior High is an incredible opportunity to learn that and I threw it all away and then pick

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,020
coding up again it's like one semester of coding in junior high and then I didn't come back to coding

57
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:20,390
until 2001 so I'm going to do it two thousand added in their cuttings strengths I like having fun and

58
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:29,620
teaching I'd say and having a good time and you know bringing some personality to it and and also a

59
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,660
humanities you know so like a totally different philosophy on like what are my strengths when it comes

60
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,890
to coding but thinking about all of those things and then if you look at my coding strengths go laying

61
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:50,470
and each shemale and CSX you know this is kind of like the core of what I teach at the college in the

62
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,940
university so that's kind of it and then V.S. code right.

63
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,130
Like just create a course on that and let's leave it at that.

64
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,710
Anything you want to share about yourself I think for that I'm going to go to YouTube.

65
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:11,510
Todd McCloud and I have this personal YouTube channel there's the Learn to code YouTube channel.

66
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,390
Here's my personal YouTube channel I'm just going to hit my volume so any audio play doesn't come up

67
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:23,900
and let's grab that you url and you can go to town on where I go go to my terminal there we go you can

68
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:30,470
go to tell him that and then also I'll add in a lot of people don't know this about me Amazon.com T.

69
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:38,690
Scott McCloud Yeah I think I've mentioned this already when we're talking about something but I just

70
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,850
think I read up through that

71
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,790
make sure that brings about you know and we'll drop that in there.

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,450
All right I'm going to exit.

73
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:57,630
I'm going to save it and I'm going to hit enter and now I'm going to just take a look.

74
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,660
That's what's in there and then get status see it my statuses get add dash dash all you can also do

75
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,580
dash a Daniels way I might start switching to that and then ads.

76
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,450
Let's do hands on exercise it's really easy to identify for whoever is accepting merge requested hands

77
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:31,520
on exercise ninja 0 1 No 0 1 4 goes to eleven about that's pretty clear and so I've stage it and I'm

78
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,840
going to do a get get add get command get status and yeah I'm just gonna go get push see what it tells

79
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,330
me.

80
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,530
So I just pushed it it's my repo and air failed to push some rest to this.

81
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,380
So let's read this enumerating objects Delta compression repressing writing remote resolving Delta's

82
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:59,320
completed to get that remote Master Master permission denied failed to push and rafts to get hub dot

83
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:06,120
com temp and cloud going project get what are your ideas on this your SDH key you're it's trying to

84
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,680
use your I.D. RSA is the default s this H key OK so so to fix that let's try this I'm going to go back

85
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:23,220
to my SS H and inside the SS HCV into my SS H we'll see if this works because in here I have those and

86
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:31,590
so I'm going to rename those rights I'm going to ream rename now and to IDR RSA bridge and I'm going

87
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,720
to rename this one to Venus he and no thank you.

88
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,990
In the ivy RSA pub to I.D. RSA

89
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:58,380
courage which was original and then I'm to rename temp to Ivy underscore our essay.

90
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:10,890
I'm gonna rename temp pub to Ivy underscore our say pub yes yes.

91
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:19,380
And now we're going to take a look and we got RSA Ridge and RSA pub ridge and then we have IDR city

92
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,570
pub and I.D. RSA.

93
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,030
Now let's try this again.

94
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,440
So we'll come back over to this one and you can launch multiple tabs and terminal.

95
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,150
I did that with command T.

96
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,630
There's a third one but we're going to come back to this one here and try that push again

97
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,620
Gene.

98
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,430
His love hacky solutions and now that that is up there.

99
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:53,530
If I come back to my profile and I look at my repositories I've got the going project here and in hands

100
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,620
on exercises I should have under about there's goes to eleven.

101
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,950
Now I'm going to log out of this account.

102
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,320
We need to merge it.

103
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,890
Thank you.

104
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:10,470
So create merge request is that's for the project.

105
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:16,760
Yeah but Newport request and you pull requests and this new poll request I'm going to go goes to eleven

106
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:23,900
so it's going to see the arrow here it's going from this to that's it goes goes to eleven going project

107
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,830
master temp Todd McCloud Girling project master that's why I want to merge and here's what I'm adding

108
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:38,570
it's that text I had so I'm going to create a pull request and a hands on exercise for Ninja 0 ninja

109
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:53,600
0 1 No one goes to Levin this is the about me for Todd cloud on get at goes to eleven and create poor

110
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,030
class

111
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,260
and checking the branches no conflicts with base.

112
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:09,940
And now we're ready there's something to log out and sign in and I'm back into my account so I'm gonna

113
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:20,160
go to my repositories and then going project and I have pull requests one.

114
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,690
And right here I'm gonna click on it.

115
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,940
And I could see temp Todd McCloud the user.

116
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,830
This is that about me for Todd McCloud and get her back goes to love and hands on exercise ninja 0 1

117
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,880
number 0 1 4 goes to Levin about this branch has no conflicts I could merge the power request or I could

118
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,600
come up here and I could see files changed and here is the file it adds this file goes to Levin it adds

119
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,510
all that code so that all looks gotta come back conversation and I could write a little message.

120
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,160
Welcome to class goes to eleven.

121
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,440
Great job on this assignment.

122
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,390
I was like myself.

123
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,930
Positive messages and I could comment and then I could merge this.

124
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:15,890
So my comic got out of there and I could emerge as pull requests and confirm merge sweep.

125
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,120
So that's my solution.

126
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,490
A hands on exercise number one.

127
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,990
Let's just make sure that I did everything so I added this little bit.

128
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:31,720
You'll emerge from the master on your 4 from the master on your fork which we just did to master on

129
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,270
the repo from which you fought so forth.

130
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:43,830
This repo on branch master go into the folder to about template about neat text copy that renamed it

131
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,020
stage command push create a pull request.

132
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,560
So that's my solution.

133
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,950
The hands on exercise number one.
