1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,150
So now I'm going to give you my solution for hands on exercise.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,810
Number three and I'm going back to my repo.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,100
I have this dummy account Todd temp Todd McLeod going project.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,600
So there's the original project which is goes to 11 go laying project.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,460
Then I fork that under My Account temp Todd McCloud a different account and then I cloned it down to

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,540
my machine.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,170
So on GitHub where I forked it you could see the temp Todd McCloud going project right there.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:37,260
And right now in 0 2 hands on exercises 0 3 I only have this starter file which was already there.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,250
I don't have Daniel's file.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,210
We're going to look at Daniel's screen now and if you see here on Daniel's screen 0 0 2 hands on exercise

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,320
0 3 purpose he's got the goes to eleven purpose text started file but he doesn't and he also has the

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:00,240
lower dose purpose text file that's like a mouthful and and so I need to get that on mine and you've

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,470
already pushed that from your fork and your clone from your clone you committed it and you pushed it

14
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,660
to your fork and then from your fork you did pull requests in from goes to Levin as a collaborator you

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,140
merge that pull requests from your other account correct.

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:16,620
Yes.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,230
And so now we're seeing that it goes to eleven going project.

18
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,180
And so I need to rebase my fork right.

19
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,490
So here's goes to 11 going project and then here's my temp GitHub file with a fork.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,620
I need to rebase this fork because right here you could see I don't have Daniel's file and if I look

21
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,020
here on the terminal.

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,420
So I was looking at GitHub.

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,390
Now I'm going to look at the clone down to my term and my my computer.

24
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,640
If I look here on the terminal if I look at print working directory I mean going project 0 0 2 hands

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,300
on exercises 0 to humble so I'm gonna see these up out of that go into 0 3 and then do it.

26
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,290
L s L.A. see everything that's in there.

27
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:03,690
I don't have Daniel's files so I want to rebase my fork with what I fought from and to do that we have

28
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:10,140
that Stack Overflow article where it's get remote add upstream I've already done this.

29
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:18,630
So if I do get branch dash a I see all of my branches where I have master I've M.S. second and then

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,290
I have upstream master right here so I've already created this upstream that could be any name.

31
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,380
So now what I want to do is just get fetch upstream.

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,580
I want to make sure that I am on master anything.

33
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,610
I say that all correctly.

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,040
Yes.

35
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,720
Yeah.

36
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,140
So the first thing I'm going to do I'm just kind of a little bit the question that just arose for me

37
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,910
which is why I ask that is it's asking me to fetch the upstream before I'm a master.

38
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,450
I mean I just need to make sure rebase but these can be done in either order.

39
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,980
Correct.

40
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,620
That's correct.

41
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,160
OK so my mind just hiccup there for a second.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,370
Like what am I doing that right.

43
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,870
So I'm going to do a get fetch upstream and hopefully this is all making a little bit of sense to you

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,820
or starting to familiarize you're starting familiarized with that and so get fetch upstream.

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,550
I find it helpful to also read through just to see what's happening here and you could see from get

46
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,550
hub dot com goes to Levin going project and if you remember in our notes we also added in some notes

47
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,020
here about get remote and get remote show origin.

48
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,850
And so that might be interesting get remote show origin if we look at that just to kind of refresh your

49
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,390
memory.

50
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,850
What we see there these are both from temp Todd McCloud.

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,710
We can also get remote show upstream and it is upstream just upstream.

52
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,110
Correct.

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,840
I don't have the master.

54
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,750
And then here you can see it's from goes to eleven and so that's kind of cool to see.

55
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,690
So I've done my get fetch and now I need to do my get checkout master.

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,880
So I want to make sure I'm a master so you can see how I get branches I'm actually on AMC seconds I'm

57
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:02,620
going to do get checkout master and then you can see I'm now on Master I've got the little Asterix there

58
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,440
plus the color coding of green and so with that I'm ready to get rebase upstream master you want to

59
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,860
pull first though just make sure you're up to date before you do rebasing emerging and once again you're

60
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:22,330
seeing the benefit of pair programming already up to date and then get re rebase upstream master get

61
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:31,840
rebase upstream master is all it good you go first rewinding had replay your work on top of it fast

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,750
forward master to upstream master and now if I take a look at where I'm at and I look at what's in there

63
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:45,290
I have or loaders or lower dose how do you say that we're all lured boost or a lord I've known that

64
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:52,140
oh this is a time to twister or Florida's his file and if I refresh here I'm not going to see I'm going

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,130
to do that the keyboard shortcut commands shift arcs I can't actually see the refresh thing and so if

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:06,070
I wanted to get this up to my temp Todd McLeod going project I have to do it get status and on branch

67
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,950
is ahead of master by form Kimmitt get pushed to publish your local commands get push

68
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,570
and now if I come back here and refresh I should see that so again go Lang goes to eleven going project

69
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,470
my fork temp Todd McCloud has a fork over here with going project and then my clone down here so I just

70
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:41,100
went from my clone up to my get hub temp Todd McCloud going project which is the fork so all that just

71
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:48,960
to get ready to do the third hands on exercise and the third hands on exercise is in 0 3 Create a branch

72
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:56,520
switch to the branch create a file purpose stage commit merge this to master on your fork and then create

73
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,290
a pull request from master on your forks I'm going to create this on a branch on my fork and emergent

74
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:10,770
to master on my fork and then merge it to goes to eleven from which I originally fought so to do that

75
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:17,970
I am now in print working directory 0 3 I'm going to nano and this file needs to be go well this is

76
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,380
going to be temp Todd McCloud because it's kind of where it's coming from.

77
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:33,120
Purpose t x t and I'm going to add in here live for others relationships are everything when you put

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,720
yourself second to the team you feel could choose pro social behavior

79
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:58,450
behavior not anti social behavior you were built to be a social animal have family and kids.

80
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,600
Your life will be great.

81
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,440
Nothing's giving my life more meaning than living for others.

82
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,780
True story.

83
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,670
All right so I have that file now I could do get.

84
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,350
But I didn't do it on a branch.

85
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:18,320
Get check out the Ashby and this branch name is going to be my purpose.

86
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,720
I did the same thing you did.

87
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,980
And now that I'm here both my branch and master has that file.

88
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,890
Except you never committed to master.

89
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,930
So let's see what we got here.

90
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,750
Is my purpose and get status and it's over here so now I could commit this interesting.

91
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,300
So if you have not state if you have not committed this to a particular branch yet your files will kind

92
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,080
of float with you as you check out between different branches.

93
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,560
Get check out will throw an error though if you if you modify a file that exists and it's different

94
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
between the branch and the original.

95
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,200
Like if you modified goes to eleven outright t it's been changed on your branch compared to Aster it'll

96
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,610
it'll tell you hey you've got.

97
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,630
I'm not sure how to change this but it is a new file site.

98
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,360
Where do you want to keep track that it's in it's indeterminate state.

99
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,320
It can just put it can just keep it with you as you move to the next file.

100
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,250
It takes a while to wrap your head around this entire thing gets very smart usually and will usually

101
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,710
just tell you okay can't do this here's why.

102
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,610
So Reed Reed gets error messages through usually good.

103
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:33,010
So now I'm going to add the file so get add and then get commit dash M and adds ninja level 0 1.

104
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,230
Exercise number 0 3 temp.

105
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,930
Todd McCloud purpose.

106
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,970
Text File temp Todd McCloud.

107
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,800
I guess we're all ultimately a little bit temporary aren't we.

108
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:56,210
We do not have ah ah life is a variable is for a defined period of time and now that I have that I could

109
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,940
do to get stats again and I'm on branch.

110
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,390
My purpose and so switched to the branch created a file stages file commit this file on emerge.

111
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,400
This branch to master branch on your fork provided descriptive comment message.

112
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:20,360
So now I'm going to merge this and so to do that get checkout master and then get merged branch to get

113
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,810
merge and I'm looking for my purpose.

114
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:33,550
I'm looking for my purpose in snagging merge that to my master and if I do get branch dash a I could

115
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,620
see that idea get status.

116
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:42,120
I could see that I'm ahead of some of my clone now I'm gonna push to temp Todd McCloud repo so I'm going

117
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:53,350
to do a get push for a master to get hub and now up here on my get hub temp Todd McCloud I hit refresh

118
00:09:53,380 --> 00:10:00,840
command shift ah and you could see Tim Todd McCloud purpose and the next thing I want to do is do a

119
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:09,190
poor request and my poor request is temp Todd McCloud Galang compare master with goes to eleven going

120
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:15,110
project base master and if I look I've got temp Todd McCloud purpose and this is what it is I'm going

121
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:23,710
to create pull requests and that's a good description and thanks for this class having fun learning

122
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,530
a lot it's awesome and I mean that I am having fun I am learning a lot.

123
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,820
It is awesome.

124
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,930
I'm going to create my pull request and thank you Daniel for joining me on this.

125
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,530
It's fun and.

126
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,810
And so now that's there.

127
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:46,520
And if we switch over to Daniel's computer he can look at the poll requests and he could pull that poll

128
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,960
request and merge that

129
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,000
suite.

130
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,790
And then on my computer you can see that my poll request has been merged.

131
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,620
And that's the whole process.

132
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,250
Do you have anything to add to it.

133
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,630
No.

134
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:11,800
You do not actually need to update your repo in order to do to but to do the poll request in this case

135
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,880
it was a file that was not touched by anyone else at all.

136
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,730
It was a new file entirely.

137
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,380
And so he could.

138
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,080
Todd could have just made the file and done all this work without having to do the rebase and updating

139
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,150
his thing gets pretty good at merging files if need be and this case is a completely new file.

140
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:36,850
So the commit get would've been smart enough to just kind of merge it in as required but the updating

141
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,000
to the latest version will prevent will mean that you're taking on the burden of merging any conflicts

142
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,630
which makes it more likely that whoever is looking at the poll requests can see no conflicts.

143
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,170
That's a lot easier of a yes it's approved.

144
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,980
If there's conflicts the person who's looking at the poll requests usually isn't the one who wants to

145
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,840
figure out what's wrong.

146
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,510
They'll send it back to you and say fix us.

147
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,280
So there are conflicts.

148
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,640
All right.

149
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,770
That's a hands on exercise number three.

150
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,670
My solution.

151
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,030
See you in the next video where we have one more hands on exercise number four.
