1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,510
Here is hands on Exercise number three.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,700
And so in this exercise you're going to emerge from the master branch on your fork.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,200
So here's your fork.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,930
Here's goes to eleven go Lang project and then down here you have your clone you have master on your

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,510
fork you're going to then you know push that back up to your fork from your clone from your computer

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,650
the cloning computer push it up to your fork you'll be on Mars you're gonna emerge from that master

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,480
to master on repo from which you fought and so at your fork of this repo in the folder.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,760
Hands on exercise 0 3 do the following create a branch titled by purpose switch to the branch create

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,160
a file called Your get hub username desk purpose dot text to share what you believe gives purpose and

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,380
meaning to human life.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:53,130
That answer might be the number forty two stages file commit this file provide a descriptive commit

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,690
message and by the way I don't mean to make a joke which it's an insider joke and if you don't know

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,570
it yet let me bring you inside.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,600
So in Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy they said a computer to figure out what the purpose and meaning

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,660
of life is.

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:10,040
And after decades and decades and decades that computer return the answer in the answer was forty two.

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,750
So just a little tech and tech law there.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:22,540
So stage this file commit this file merge this branch to the brute to the master branch on your fork.

19
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,010
Right.

20
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,300
So you're going to merge it to master on your fork.

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,490
So on your clone and then you're going to push that up to year you're your fork from your computer where

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,660
it's cloned from your fork.

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,790
You're going to push that merged master up to your fort and then from there on GitHub you're going to

24
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,620
make a pull request over it goes it goes to eleven.

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,270
So go ahead.

26
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,350
So create a pull request from branch master on your fork to branch master on this repo.

27
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,110
Go ahead and pause this video and I could do that.

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,170
Hands on exercise and when you're all done.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,130
Now y'all come on back and we'll show you our hands on exercise which we're gonna do right now.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,950
And are you going to have to reboot.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,460
So Daniel is going to start out on this.

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,520
Are you going to have to do the rebase deal because you don't have my latest file.

33
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,240
Yeah I want to hammer through that.

34
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,320
I've got to I've also got the problem too.

35
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,480
I've got the.

36
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,260
When I was on branch Mass.

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:23,880
When I was on Master I made those two comments and I don't really want those to be in my history at

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,110
all.

39
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:24,930
So I'm.

40
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,780
So my solution was probably just to do the recoding or the reef just to rework it.

41
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,160
OK so.

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,810
So another way you could do it just delete it on your local machine and then re fork and re clone.

43
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,450
Yep.

44
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,640
So first I would go to the hub and go on my fork.

45
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,820
Go to Settings go at the very bottom in the danger zone delete my fork.

46
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,620
They require you to confirm by putting in the name the full name of the repo.

47
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,570
That is your username name slash the repo name.

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,660
I understand it's and you also need to put in your password.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,170
Well edit this out.

50
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,340
Your repositories been deleted and it's on there.

51
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,260
It does not exist anymore.

52
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,510
Now I go back to those two.

53
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,210
Then

54
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,630
googling project and I can rework

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,220
in the meantime I can go back here to my clone and I can delete it.

56
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,140
Which require mean which requires me to make sure my command line is not in the folder.

57
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,520
So now I've got a read I've been reformed I'm up to date and I can re clone with SS H.

58
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,690
So it goes to Levin going project used to lead everything on your machine you deleted everything on

59
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,710
your get hub from your fork and then you said let's fork it again let's clone it again.

60
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:08,100
So now if I go going project 0 0 2 0 2 humble and I look in here I can see I've got to go through I've

61
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,390
been humble to so if you don't have anything that you want to have kept.

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,000
If you don't have anything in your fork that's separate from the origin.

63
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:27,420
This is probably an easier way to pull your fork up to date or at least step it simpler at least.

64
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,950
So now you can go back in

65
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,930
here did

66
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,600
all right.

67
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,920
So now you're ready do hands on Exercise number three yet.

68
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:53,350
And for this hands on exercise you're gonna create a branch called my purpose for this to get check

69
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,190
out dash B my purpose.

70
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,750
You gonna switch to that branch make sure you're on it you're automatically on it and now you're going

71
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,930
to Sheriff Lee you believe gives purpose and meaning to life in a file and that file B or your user

72
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:14,630
name dash purpose dot t t create a file your user name on GitHub dash purpose that T.

73
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,020
And then in that file share what you believe gives purpose and meaning to life could be forty two years

74
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,470
want to be generous and keep it simple or you get philosophical and share a little bit with us

75
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,520
there's the file so I can get at it.

76
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,860
At this commit am.

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,990
You need it.

78
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,050
Yeah.

79
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:51,070
Yeah exercise is a level 1 exercise.

80
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,560
That's a good way to do that.

81
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
That's nice.

82
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,330
Get status.

83
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,400
I'm still in a branch my purpose but I've committed so I will push my branch to merge.

84
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,040
So I'm pushing my branch to my fork.

85
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,030
No I can't.

86
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,430
I can.

87
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,600
I.

88
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,140
Which is kind of an optional thing.

89
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,410
I can merge to master straight into your machine and never let my fork know the branch ever existed.

90
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,540
Yeah but.

91
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,960
Or I can push it.

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,690
Got it kind of.

93
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,090
Either way you can't do the pull request method to merge on your own fork.

94
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:31,820
If you were if you'd ever pushed so so I could push it or I could get check out back to master once

95
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,960
a master I can get.

96
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,760
I'll always want to make sure you pull first before you do any kind of merging just to make sure you're

97
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,460
up to date.

98
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,640
And now I can get merge.

99
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,180
Purpose.

100
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,950
Purchase

101
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,490
anyhow.

102
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,510
I've merged that thing and I can get push it

103
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,600
which takes a little bit of time.

104
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:07,620
Here I've got the added ninja level 1 exercise 3 commit and a shortcut for making Polocrosse is there

105
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,410
will be a short shortcut button there if you're in a forked repo that has that's ready to make people

106
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:13,960
request.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,430
So from my going project master to go to heaven going project master make my request description up

108
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,160
above is plenty good balance.

109
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,390
Good.

110
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,610
Yeah.

111
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,510
The title I don't think you mean that comment.

112
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:27,870
Yeah.

113
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,390
Sweep under and they will accept it on the.

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,450
Goes to Levin three and goes fucking going project now be accepted.

115
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,730
It is done.

116
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,830
Well done.

117
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,470
Anything you want to add.

118
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:57,210
Just just another re re essay restating if you don't have anything in your fork that's worth that you've

119
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,960
changed that you want to keep.

120
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,770
Simplest way to update to the newest version is just delete your fork and rework and you delete it both

121
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,740
locally on your machine and on your get hub account.

122
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,430
Get all that stuff out of there and then you go back to the one you want to fork and you re fork it

123
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,460
right.
