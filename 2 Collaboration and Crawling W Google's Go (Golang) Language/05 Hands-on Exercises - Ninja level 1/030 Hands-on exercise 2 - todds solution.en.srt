1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,890
So here's my solution to the second hands on exercise and to do this I'm going to create a branch and

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:12,600
then create a file and on that branch and so that branch will be down here on my machine and in my clone

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:22,230
of my fork which is off of you know go laying going it goes to eleven going project and so and then

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,080
I'm going to merge that over to go Lang goes to eleven off of that branch and so I'm gonna go into my

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,490
repo I'm just going to take a look see where I'm at and I'm in zero to humble you could see go laying

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,080
project 0 2 hands on exercise of zero to humble which is where I want to be.

7
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,040
I already have a file there which I put up and so just for convenience if you want to read my answer

8
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,930
you can pause the video and then take a look at that answer right there for humble.

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,190
I'm gonna put up a second file.

10
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,750
I'm going to call.

11
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,970
But first I have to create a branch so I'm going to get check out dash B and give it a name and this

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:08,400
will be you know M.C. second you know whatever I want to branch being that can you get branch dash a.

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,680
And take a look at all those and confirm I'm on M.C. second.

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,950
And so now I could take a look at what's in there and I'm going to create a new file and this new file

15
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:30,670
B goes to eleven and humble to don t x t spittle it goes to eleven eleven goes to eleven humbled to

16
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:39,820
Dot T X T and in here I'm gonna reflect instead of on humbling and reflect on integrity and integrity

17
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:52,150
is never take that which wasn't freely given and there I think that's enough and it's a good principle

18
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:58,510
to reflect upon and I'm going to hit enter so now I can do it get status and I may get status I have

19
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:10,720
this new file so I could do a get add dash a and get commit dash M and hands on project ninja 0 1 number

20
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:22,490
number 0 2 second goes to eleven file and and so now I have all that and I could do a get push so this

21
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,120
is going to push it up from my clone on my computer it's gonna push it up to my fork what I fought from

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,400
goes to lemons can push up to my fork on GitHub they're pushed out on up and it's saying get push setup

23
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,290
string origin and second so I need to do that so it adds the branch up on github does say that correctly.

24
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:50,360
So this is more of a telling your system that M.C. second is coming off of origin as opposed to upstream

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,130
so you what you want make sure empty seconds pushing too origin you don't want to put an empty deck

26
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,110
and you push upstream because you you're not allowed to write upstream Oh good.

27
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,120
So it's setting it to origin goes to my fork right.

28
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,080
Yeah.

29
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:15,210
And now that I have all that I could come in to get hub and get hub come in there and here's my top

30
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,500
temp Tom McCloud going project and.

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,390
And now if I look at my branches I have two branches and so I have M.S. second right here and I could

32
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,330
do a new poll request when you click that and hands on project where do I want it to go.

33
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm gonna go from temp Todd McCloud going project M.S. second 2 goes to Levon go long project master

34
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:50,030
and the second file for goes to eleven or ninja oh on number two and create pas request

35
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,420
and now the poor request has been made.

36
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,160
So if I log out or do you have it on yours and want to do it.

37
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,930
I got access so I couldn't just go back to

38
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,090
this to you.

39
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,720
Then

40
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,600
back to the original project.

41
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,120
I can see the pull requests.

42
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,010
I can see it.

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,140
There it is.

44
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,020
See files change shoes.

45
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,660
Looks good

46
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:31,890
Burj

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,470
and then over on my machine that tells me it's now been merged this poll request has been merge.

48
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,100
That's pretty good.

49
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,780
Pretty good.

50
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,430
I liked that.

51
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,870
Did we get everything for that.

52
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,350
I created a branch and I didn't call my humble I just called it whatever.

53
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:58,150
And and then I created a file and in the file share it being humble stage commit push create a pull

54
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,010
request to master on this repo.

55
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,860
So that's my solution.

56
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,960
A hands on exercise number two.

57
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,250
You got anything else you want add.

58
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,060
Nope that's it.
