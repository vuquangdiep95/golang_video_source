1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,090
So here's a hands on exercise number one.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,670
And so I'm going to introduce this hands on exercise.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,610
Then you're going to pause the video you're going to pause the video and you're going to go and do the

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,130
hands on exercise and then when you're all done you're gonna come back and unplugged the video and you'll

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,660
see our solution.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,660
So for those first hands on exercise we're gonna do an introduction and an introduction to in classes

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,890
as a common practice.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,540
Everybody introduces themselves and so we wanted to have an introduction in here.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:37,590
We're not asking for you know well you could see here we'll go and get hub and you can go to about and

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,880
we have a little template here.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,540
So you're welcome to include whatever information you want in the introduction but I just provided like

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,480
yea started coding coding strings comma separated list and anything you want to share about yourself.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,450
So pretty simple pretty innocuous but also kind of interesting to maybe see who else is in the class.

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,650
And we're gonna do this in a way where we are identified through our Twitter user name because that's

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,430
unique.

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,570
So we can explain the rest out.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,210
And second I just want to say one more little bit about the introduction and respect this format here

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,210
because later in the course or maybe later in the future course we could take this data and if it's

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,600
unstructured format we can use it as an example to pass through a whole bunch of files and be able to

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,880
pull out that information and put it into some other storage structure and then maybe use that to connect

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,370
it to an interface web interface or a Web site or something like that that might be interesting.

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,450
And so anyhow there's a little template that you can fill out and for this for this hands on an exercise

23
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,750
you're going to introduce yourself feel free to provide as much information about this right here.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,310
Fill these out if you want or not.

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,380
It's totally optional or you can make it up and.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,650
And to do that you're gonna fork this repos or fork.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,920
The goal line project repo that's our our project here.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,190
So that's kind of what we did in the exercises.

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:06,330
And then on branch master go into the folder 0 0 2 hands on exercises 0 1 about and so that is 0 0 2

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:14,040
hands on exercises 0 1 about and make a copy of the 0 0 template about me text.

31
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:21,510
And so here's 0 0 a template about me taxi or copy that file then rename your copy to your get hub user

32
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,180
named T X T.

33
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,140
And in the file to the extent that you feel comfortable introduce and share about yourself stage this

34
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,290
file commit this file provide a descriptive comment message push this commit to your fork create a pull

35
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,850
request to branch master on this repo right.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,140
And so I already explained this the structure of the file and then the second note as if for some reason

37
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,380
the template is no longer there simply you could recreate it or just provide a description herself.

38
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,850
So for some reason you can't find that.

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
Just do a work.

40
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,390
That's the hands on exercise.

41
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,260
Sorry I'm a little bit long winded pauses video go do that.

42
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,970
Hands on exercise I think that's kind of fun getting close to the camera and then when you're all done.

43
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,090
Come on back now y'all and we'll show you our solution what you're gonna do right now.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,250
So hopefully you've already paused the video and gone and done your hands on exercise let's do it.

45
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,120
Who wants to go first you or me.

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,040
Doesn't matter.

47
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,280
Shambo.

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Rock paper scissors.

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,450
Oh I'm going first.

50
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,280
Lucky me.

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,950
Or do I get it.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,900
No you won.

53
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,100
You get to choose.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,810
I'll go first.

55
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,680
Oh you're gonna go first.

56
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,260
Awesome.

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,430
So on the page I'm a collaborator.

58
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,170
But doesn't matter.

59
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,410
I can fork it anyway.

60
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,640
So fork it

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,230
which takes a little bit as GitHub copies everything over.

62
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,560
It's not that long.

63
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,360
Right.

64
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,090
I've got my copy of it.

65
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,330
I can clone this grass stage setup so I can keep it.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
The sage copy openness.

67
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:06,880
I will go back and make this just in my home folder here that serves me out windows backslash is

68
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,020
clone the project and now I can't

69
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,760
open Faulkner up

70
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:36,730
to 1 it's.

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:44,590
So did location.

72
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,290
So you started coding do a file say about this.

73
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,610
Yeah.

74
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,650
Yes.

75
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,120
So it doesn't overwrite just so we don't forget.

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,660
I know you're probably just working out in a different order so you get hub user name and then what

77
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,970
is it and then not text.

78
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,400
That's it.

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,960
Yep.

80
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,620
Perfect so you're coding coding strings.

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,440
Anything else you want to share of code you're sorry coding.

82
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,140
I started coding fairly young.

83
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:18,620
It's actually been started way say somewhere thereabouts.

84
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,790
I like how your conservative

85
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,600
coding strengths.

86
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,090
More.

87
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:36,720
More structured programming and so going with its types over more flexible stuff like Javascript so

88
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,580
so a structured programming go laying

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,360
anything else you are share about yourself.

90
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:04,470
Uh I enjoy learning new programming things and I would add in super great dude.

91
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,520
And what are the individuals with the highest integrity I've ever met.

92
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,580
And super values and principle based like this guy's a rock.

93
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,640
He's unshakable.

94
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,460
Like if I had a briefcase with a billion dollars and I had to leave it with somebody and entrust them

95
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,220
with it.

96
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,330
I'd give it to Daniel.

97
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,530
He might not take it.

98
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,500
He'd be like I know what all this cash is for.

99
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,830
But I know I'd be safe here.

100
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,910
You would misappropriate it.

101
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,450
So a really good guy like I messed up a little bit man.

102
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,020
So you're a good guy.

103
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,220
Yeah.

104
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:35,680
There we go.

105
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,980
We got the description.

106
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,560
3 three things shared so I get that it's I am not in the correct folder which is why I always do get

108
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,820
said is first to make sure I get and oh get.

109
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:01,980
Commit and it s first excerpts.

110
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,400
Is

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:10,880
thinking when

112
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,140
I can push

113
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,160
it now on my repo.

114
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,930
Good project.

115
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,690
It's got my thing here.

116
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:41,610
The last comment was mine is my committee and so I can make a pull request it's just a nice shortcut

117
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,210
there.

118
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:49,990
So from always going project Manchester to master I think I messed up there.

119
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,970
I think it was was close to branch.

120
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,990
No no no it's just right off master.

121
00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:00,680
No grand master master so the master to master create a pull request.

122
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:08,270
I have added my file for the first yet.

123
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,920
And on

124
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,160
exercise.

125
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,040
Uh.

126
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,770
Request

127
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,020
and that's it.

128
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,850
That's all that's needed for this particular

129
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,670
nice well done.

130
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,530
And then we switch back.

131
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,700
Did you merge it already.

132
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,520
I have not merged it.

133
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,720
Let's see that.

134
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:48,500
So coming back to in goes club and going project as a collaborator I am capable of merging my own request.

135
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:58,350
So it's got some nice default stuff for me as the merger or as a collaborator so I can average this

136
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,730
sweet now.

137
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,090
It's the ladies comment on goes to love and going project is this merger request.

138
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,890
Is the merge is the merge commit.

139
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,420
If I look back at commits I can see the actual comment I made on my repo.

140
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,170
Nice great.

141
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Well done.

142
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,420
That's a hands on exercise.

143
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,170
No one.
