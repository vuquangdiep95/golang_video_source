1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,290
So now we're going to add a new major dependency and major dependency.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,650
You know if you remember the the versioning.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,010
We have major would be that one.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,880
We have minor.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,500
And then we have a patch.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,050
And so with a new major version here like we have three versions of a package three major versions of

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,060
a package.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,910
And this would be version one.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,370
And then if his version two or version three or so on is going to be followed by a V to V Three.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,930
And you could have one of each of these.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,790
So you could have code from the first major version code from the second major version and code from

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:44,850
the third major version but you can have code from two like you know like major version one point six

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,770
and one point eight.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,630
You can't have two minor versions or you can't have patches right.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,730
One of each of these.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,750
And so having one of each of those allows you to upgrade incrementally and upgrading incrementally means

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,850
that you know maybe you're using one version too came out well you could still use some of the code

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,680
from one you could still use some of the code and you could use some of the code from two.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,560
And so here our code is going to change and we'll have our CIO quote and then we're gonna ask CIO quote

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,380
version 3 and we're going to import that with an alias of quote version 3 and we're going to be able

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:28,570
to call this proverb function and some proverb is pulling quote version 3 concurrency proverb and and

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:36,030
then that's coming from you know version 3 whereas this right here our CIO quote is bringing in this

23
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,990
one right here quote.

24
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,790
Hello.

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,230
So we're pulling from Version 1 and from version 3.

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,680
And so you could get different major versions and pull code from each which allows you to upgrade incrementally

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,730
and then we added a test for the proverb.

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,580
So that's the idea with the code and to see that in action.

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,520
Do you have something you'd like to add to that.

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,110
No to see that in action.

31
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,080
We've already created that code base here it's a 0 3 add a major dependency.

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,120
So I'm just going to navigate there on my terminal take a look at working directory see where I am and

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:18,780
go into S.D. 0 0 3 modules and then 0 3 add major dependency and then come back and do me just bring

34
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,770
this down a little bit.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,440
So you could see the commands as I do.

36
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,860
Do you go test.

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,370
So I'm testing that code at all passes I could do a cat to see what's in my go mod file but I have to

38
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:37,200
come up a level and there and be right there and I could see now that I've got our AC quote version

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,260
one point five two.

40
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:48,360
And we also have our AC Io quote version 3 and that's the version three point one point zero and then

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:56,610
the one that we specifically specified in the previous video was our CIO sampler version one point three

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,580
point one which we still have here as one of our indirect dependencies.

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,720
And so that's doing the CATCo mod and we can also see all of those by doing goalless dash them all.

44
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,800
And also here's an interesting little notation that you could use if you wanted to see just are a C

45
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,240
Io quote right.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:27,880
What are those that my module depends upon either directly or indirectly and it will show you OK.

47
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,870
Anything to say.

48
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,400
No no I got it all yes.

49
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,850
All right.

50
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,160
So that's that's adding a new major dependency.
