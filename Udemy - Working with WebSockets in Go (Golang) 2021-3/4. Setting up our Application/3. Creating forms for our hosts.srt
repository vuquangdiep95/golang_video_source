1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,770
So we have some database tables for our hosts, for our services and for our host services, and now

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,780
we need to create some forms that will allow us to enter some information into the database.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,050
So I'm looking at the application which is running right now.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,970
And if I go to the hosts button and then click on, there's nothing listed here.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,090
Of course, this is where our hosts will be listed.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,490
Once we have some in the database, I don't want to click on the new host button and that takes me to

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,510
an empty page.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,490
And the empty page has a breadcrumb at the top and then a place for content underneath.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,050
And here's where I want to put my form.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,190
And the form I want to put there is actually going to be a TABD page.

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:42,820
I'll use bootstraps tabs to create a page that has a host tab that will just give the basic information

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,490
about the host, the managed services that will allow us to list the services and add or delete any

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,930
services we want to monitor then one tab for each of the possible statuses.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,530
So a healthy tab, warning problems and pending.

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,970
And each of those tabs will list services that we're monitoring that are in one of those states.

16
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,130
So all the healthy will show up and are healthy and so on.

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,040
So let's get started doing that.

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:12,610
So I'm going to go over to my ID and this is the host page hosted Jet and it's found inside The View's

19
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,000
folder.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:21,250
So inside of that, in this content area, I'm going to I'm going to create a new div and it'll be a

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,720
div of class row.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,110
And inside of that I'll create a div of class call.

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,720
And this is where our content is going to go.

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,910
Now I know I want to TABD page and if you go back to the application, I already have a tab page.

25
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,620
I have one here for settings that has general notification, so on and so forth.

26
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:44,410
So what I'm going to do is open up the settings page and just copy this part that creates the tabs for

27
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,840
me just to save some typing.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,360
So I'll go back to host Jet and I'll just paste that right in here and then I'll modify this as necessary.

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,250
So it's not for settings, it's for host.

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,960
And the first part is not general, it is the host.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,000
So I'll call this the host tab.

32
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:13,270
The second one is for managed services, so I'll call it the service tab and it will go to the service

33
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,930
content and this will go to the host content.

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,100
And this is referring to Divs that don't exist yet.

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,180
But we'll get to those in a moment.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,690
Then I'm going to have my healthy tab.

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,980
So for healthy services and I'll call this healthy.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,450
And I'll get rid of the icon, because I don't need that.

39
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:40,610
And to have an icon up here now, it looks OK, so healthy can be that one, and that will go to healthy

40
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,030
content and then we'll have warning.

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,720
And again, I don't need an icon for that, so I'll delete that little tag there, and this is for warning.

42
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,990
Warning.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,440
That looks right, so after warning, we'll have problem services, so a copy and paste and this will

44
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,180
be for problem tab.

45
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,200
Problems.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,870
Problem content.

47
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:24,700
And the last one is for pending, and that will be the pending tab for pending.

48
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,800
Pending.

49
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,420
I think that's it.

50
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,030
So none of those divs exist yet, which is not a problem, let's just go see what the page looks like.

51
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,940
So go back to Host's new host.

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,210
And there now we have some tips and we can put some content in each of those.

53
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:52,160
So underneath that, if you look back at the settings page, we're going to have a div class equals

54
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,970
tab content, which I'll copy and put that underneath the URL and it has to have a closing tag.

55
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:06,060
So we'll put a closing tag in now and reformat that and then back to settings to see how this works.

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,010
So inside of that we have a debate div class equals content.

57
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,800
So put that in there.

58
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,330
It's a tab pain and we'll close that and that has to have the correct you URL or ID and right now it

59
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:20,780
doesn't.

60
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,990
It's labeled by the very first tab, which is called Host Tab.

61
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,350
And it's I.D. is host content, so now a copy that.

62
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,430
It host content.

63
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,540
Host Hebb host content that is good, why do I have a oh, so I copied the wrong thing here.

64
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,730
Let me go back to settings.

65
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,650
Post content.

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,650
All right.

67
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,060
Host Tab's host KAB contest there, just give it a different idea and see if that works host Tab's.

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,960
That looks good.

69
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,180
OK, so I have this and let's just make sure it works by putting the word host content in here.

70
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,200
Then we'll copy this and paste it one, two, three, four, five times.

71
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,880
But first of all, post it once and get rid of active.

72
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,310
And the second one, does it have a show on it, I can't remember.

73
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,780
No, it doesn't.

74
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:40,830
OK, so we'll get rid of the show here, so the second one is for services content and it's labeled

75
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,960
by services tab.

76
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:50,430
Now, I can paste this as many more times as I need to, and it looks like I need one, two, three,

77
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,390
four more taps.

78
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:58,620
OK, so this will be services content paste two, three, four.

79
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,110
And the last one was pending.

80
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,540
Pending.

81
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,970
Pending tab.

82
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,290
Is there an extra tab in there?

83
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,050
Problem TEB.

84
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,930
Problem, problem.

85
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,030
And then it was warning.

86
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,030
Warning.

87
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,070
Warning tab and get rid of all these extra tabs.

88
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,940
And this one is healthy.

89
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:49,060
And this should be healthy and we will spell warning, right, since I'm here anyway.

90
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,390
All right, let's save this and make sure that we get everything right.

91
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:58,090
So I should see content under all of these casso managed services.

92
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,190
Didn't work healthy does morning does problem does pending does.

93
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,740
So the one that's not working is managed services.

94
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,210
Let's see what we got wrong with that one.

95
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,290
Managed services.

96
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,460
I got an extra tab in there.

97
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:09,850
OK.

98
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,170
Tap safe.

99
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,830
So now these tabs should all work.

100
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,870
They're not pretty yet, but we'll make them pretty in a moment.

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,000
Those reload, this still not working services TAB services content.

102
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,480
Services content.

103
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,930
There you go to get your I.D. matched up for the tabs, just don't work, and just so you know, the

104
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,790
way the tabs are built here is using the bootstrap alpha version, which happened to be the version

105
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,830
of bootstrap that was built into this template.

106
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,720
You may have the final version of bootstrap depending on a bootstrap five, depending on when you're

107
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,560
taking this course.

108
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,690
But just look at the documentation or use the alpha version that worked fine for the purposes of this

109
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:51,990
course.

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,530
This is, of course, about WebSocket, and we're just going through the steps necessary to get to the

111
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
point where we can work with WebSocket.

112
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:04,790
OK, so now we need to put a form in here and put the form, first of all, in this part.

113
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:12,590
So let's put it in a div class equals row and a div class equals call.

114
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,820
So we'll have rows and columns within this tab and inside of this will put our form and I'll put the

115
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,320
form tag in in a little bit.

116
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,990
Right now I just want to get the elements in there, so I'm going to have this in two calls.

117
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:32,400
So instead of a div class call, I'll say div class call MDX and call excess 12.

118
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,880
So if you're hitting it on a phone, everything will appear in one column.

119
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,850
But if you're on something bigger than a phone, then you'll get the two columns just to make the make

120
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,400
better use of screen real estate.

121
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,460
So let's put it in our first form control.

122
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,030
So let's first of all, look at our database to see what our very first piece of information is.

123
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,550
So I'm looking at the vigilante database at the host table ID.

124
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,990
I don't need to worry about that, but I definitely want to hostname, so I need to put it in a text

125
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,470
input.

126
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:07,230
So I'll put in a div class equals EMB three just to give it some padding on the bottom.

127
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,910
Then I'll put it a label and it will be four.

128
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,730
And the very first column was called Hostname.

129
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,350
So I'll call the same thing here.

130
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:22,920
Hostname and I will put in a class of form control which are supposed to.

131
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:38,000
And the label will be hosting them and then we'll put our input in input, Heidi, equals hostname name

132
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,790
equals host name value equals I'll leave that empty will populate that with information from the database

133
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,180
and a bit.

134
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,360
But we need to get it first and then we'll have its type is text.

135
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,450
And its class is equal to form control, form text.

136
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,690
No firm control.

137
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,810
Yeah, form control and this one's wrong is supposed to be formed, labeled.

138
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,450
OK, let's see how that looks back to our our Web browser and go to the host and reload.

139
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,570
And there probably need a little bit of space at the top here.

140
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,970
So let's put some space at the top as well.

141
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,600
Merge and top three.

142
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,740
Let's see how that looks.

143
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,780
Reload, that looks better.

144
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,210
OK, so I have one place to enter information right here for the hostname.

145
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,140
What's next back and look at our database after the hostname.

146
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,250
We have the canonical name.

147
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,420
OK, so let's just go back and make things really easy.

148
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,990
We'll copy this.

149
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,180
Paste it in here.

150
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,130
We don't need to merge in top on this one.

151
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,500
And this is canonical name.

152
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,970
Canonical name.

153
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:03,270
Which I will copy and paste and paste and changes to canonical name.

154
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,610
OK, that should look OK and it does.

155
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,230
And the third element is after canonical name is Earl.

156
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,950
So let's copy this.

157
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:27,280
Paced, and this is just called you URL, so copy paste, paste and get rid of this and put your URL

158
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,460
and the next one is the IP address and then IP version six.

159
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:43,920
So paste, paste, and this is for IP, IP address, version for.

160
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,360
IP, IP.

161
00:11:50,010 --> 00:12:02,040
IP and did I have an underscore in the name, I can't remember no IP Version six copy paste, paste,

162
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,600
IP

163
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,400
address, version six.

164
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,700
And again, we may not use that, but we may and we may as well put it in there.

165
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,670
So then location OS and active and I'll put those in another column just to make this a little more

166
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,330
attractive.

167
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,580
So we have a call here and I'll close this, call them off and then I'll create another call.

168
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,670
Div class equals call MMD six, call excess 12.

169
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,000
Just so things are in two columns and location is the next one.

170
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,250
So let's put paste that in here and I'll just put a blank space in there to make it a little more readable

171
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,290
location.

172
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,190
Location, copy paste.

173
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,510
Paced and this does want the padding at the top, so, um, empty three, I think is what I used.

174
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,060
Let's see how that looks.

175
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,490
Now, that's looking good so far.

176
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,550
OK, operating system, I think is next operating system and then active.

177
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,570
So let's put it in an operating system.

178
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,950
And I'll just copy this one.

179
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,220
Right here.

180
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:33,870
And this is operating system, which I called os, os, os operating system.

181
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,460
And that should look good, looks OK, and the last bit we want is an active right here and I'm not

182
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,260
going to use a dropdown box, I'll use a toggle kind of like this monitoring one right here, OK, just

183
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,310
because it's more attractive.

184
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,080
So that comes right after operating system.

185
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:57,190
I want a div class equals form check.

186
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,750
Form switch, and this is just a nice thing built into bootstrap five, that gives us an attractive

187
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,440
toggle which looks better than a radio button or a checkbox or something like that.

188
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,410
So we put an input in their class equals form check input.

189
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,590
Type is a checkbox.

190
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,320
And the I.D. will be active.

191
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,750
And the name will be active, which are better spelled right?

192
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:45,900
And then we put our label after it, label class equals form, check that out, get rid of that check

193
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,730
label.

194
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,180
Four equals active.

195
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,450
And active.

196
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,720
OK, so I might have to put an emergent top in there.

197
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,390
Let's just go see what it looks like first.

198
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,510
It looks OK.

199
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,880
I think I can live with that.

200
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:12,150
OK, so there's a place to enter some information about our actual hosts.

201
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,830
So let's put a form tag around this whole thing and I will put a form tag around the whole tab list

202
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,920
just in case I have form elements on other pages.

203
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,040
I don't think I will, but if I ever want to in the future, it'll just save me.

204
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,310
Reformatting this entire page subform method equals post.

205
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,450
Our action will be exactly the same as the world to this page.

206
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,150
So that will be slash.

207
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,790
Let's go look at the URL slash admin slash host slash the idea of the host so I don't have the idea

208
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,200
of the host right now, so I'll just put zero in there admin.

209
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,580
Post and I'll put zero in there.

210
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,050
And I do want validation on this form and I'll use bootstraps validation, and that requires that I

211
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,450
put no validation here and to give it a class of needs validation.

212
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,880
And we'll give it an ID ID equals host form, so that's my opening tag there.

213
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,370
I don't want to close it straight away.

214
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,130
I'll close it right after the last panel, which would be right here and format everything.

215
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,850
And if I go back here and reload, the only thing missing right now is a save button.

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,180
Well, I already have one on the settings page, so let's just copy that one.

217
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,290
Down the bottom somewhere here, there's a safe.

218
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,490
I'll just search for safe.

219
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,080
There it is.

220
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,870
OK, so I will copy this.

221
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:45,830
And I'll put the counsel in there as well and go back to my host page and after the forum closes, where

222
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,240
do I want this save button?

223
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,750
I think I just want it on the first tab.

224
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,220
So that would be right here.

225
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,530
And I have a row.

226
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:10,670
So close that row, open a new row after that div class equals row, div class equals call and paste

227
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,620
that in there and maybe I'll put a

228
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,550
horizontal rule before it.

229
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,150
OK, so is there anything in that I need to do in there?

230
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,380
No, not right now.

231
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,720
Of course this is calling JavaScript.

232
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,970
That doesn't exist yet, but let's just see what it looks like.

233
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,820
Save, save and close saving.

234
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,660
Continue and cancel.

235
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,650
Perfect and cancel.

236
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,450
Shouldn't take us back to admin overview.

237
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,160
You should take us back to host.

238
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,390
So let's reload this.

239
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:44,780
And there is no House page, so what what did I call that admin host, all admin host, all save.

240
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,660
Let's go to a new host and now cancel.

241
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,520
Should take me back to the previous page.

242
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,520
And it does.

243
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,350
All right.

244
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,630
So there we have our forum built.

245
00:17:54,170 --> 00:18:00,590
Now we need to actually write some handlers that will either pull a host out of the database and display

246
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:07,850
it on this page with all of these things pre populated or to create an empty hosts object and pass it

247
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,720
to this page so we know we're creating a new host and leave these empty.

248
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,280
And then the next step will be to create the database handlers and database functions and the handlers.

249
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:23,930
So when I click this button saving continue or save and close, it will actually validate the information,

250
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,670
populate the database and take us to some other page and we'll take care of that in the next lecture

251
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,240
or two.
