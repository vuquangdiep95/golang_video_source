1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:08,340
OK, so right now we have just the markup for this and as I said last time, right now, if I look at

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,070
my database and I go over here to my database client, I have one host in the database with an idea

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,560
of one, but I have no home services.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,550
And while I could write the necessary code to add a record if it doesn't exist for HTP in house services,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,080
I think it's cleaner and simpler to actually add the services and mark them as inactive at the point

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,840
of entry.

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,790
So what I'm going to do is go back to my database and go back to my house table and just delete this

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,440
post entirely and save changes.

9
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,560
So now there's no host.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,800
So if I go to hosts, there's nothing in there.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,790
So let's go back to our code and modify that insert method, which is insert host in host, underscore

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,650
PostgreSQL ago.

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,380
And before I return the ID, I'm going to add host services and set to inactive.

14
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,210
So we need a statement which will be assigned the value of and I'll just do this with back takes on

15
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,230
multiple lines, insert into host services and what I want to insert in there.

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,950
Let's go look at the structure of that host services structure.

17
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,510
I want to insert hosted service died inactive, so host ID, service ID and active.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:39,330
I also want to insert schedule number and schedule unit schedule no better spell right schedule unit

19
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,230
comma and then last check.

20
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,710
I'll leave out a let that stay as null created an updated ut.

21
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,440
I will definitely do and status.

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,980
I will definitely definitely definitely do so.

23
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,060
Status created at updated at values.

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,760
And the first thing is my host ID and I'll be getting that from this new ID variable we have right here.

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,680
The next one is my service ID, which is just one, that is the one that I have in my database.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:17,700
Now, just as an aside, when I actually inserted my services and if I look at the content the first

27
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,520
time around, it had to because I must have been playing with this table.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,060
At some point.

29
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,640
You need to make sure that the one service you have in your services table has an idea of one.

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,310
So if necessary, go and change that just to be safe.

31
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,650
Krab.

32
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,390
So service I.T. active is going to be set to zero because I want it to be inactive by default schedule.

33
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,950
No, I believe that's an end.

34
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,110
But let's make sure structure schedule number is an integer and schedule unit as character.

35
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,680
Very so a number.

36
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,550
I'll make it three minutes schedule unit.

37
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,730
That's minutes for M and four minutes then status which will be pending because that's a character very

38
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,550
column created and updated.

39
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:05,370
I'll just do dollars on two in dollar sign three and I'll use the built in time package to get the current

40
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,060
timestamp.

41
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,030
So let's make sure we have this right.

42
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:16,080
Insert into host services, host ID, service ID, active schedule, no schedule unit status created

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,890
at updated UT.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,350
So that is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

45
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,100
I look at that right.

46
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,580
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,270
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

48
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,280
OK, so that's our statement.

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,320
Let's execute that statement.

50
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,620
We get a result that I don't care about.

51
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,190
An error that I do is assign the value of my DB context, pass it the context.

52
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,570
My first value will be the idea of my host, which is stored in the variable new ID.

53
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,300
My second value is time now and my third value is time now.

54
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,630
OK, let's check for an error.

55
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:05,400
If error is not equal to nil, will return a new ID and the error.

56
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,480
OK, so that new ID.

57
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,710
Context new.

58
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,080
What's to say you cannot use military type as type string?

59
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,840
Oh, yeah, I'm going to put my Creary in there, CMT, that's better.

60
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,470
OK, so that should take care of it.

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,140
So I need to start my application, start my application and go at a new host.

62
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,840
So I'll say new host.

63
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,150
And again, I'll use the same thing I did last time.

64
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:45,560
Localhost localhost you url is HDB localhost 880 IP addresses one two seven zero zero one.

65
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,010
Don't care about IP version six.

66
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:54,270
It's in New Brunswick and the operating system is Mac os x and I will make it active and hopefully if

67
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,780
I save this, ok, changes are saved and if I look at the host services table, I should now have one

68
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,860
service in their content refresh and I do.

69
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,960
And the service idea is one perfect.

70
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,940
OK, so now we have that information in there by default, which is much cleaner.

71
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,430
Now if we had a second service, we would have to of course, come in here and add the second service.

72
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,310
If I had multiple services, what I would actually do is query the services table and then loop through

73
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,970
the results of that and add one inactive service for each of the services available into my host services

74
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,270
table.

75
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,660
But we just have one and this will suffice for our purposes at the moment.

76
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,940
So what's the next step?

77
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:44,130
The next step is to go back here and modify this so that when I toggle this, it somehow updates the

78
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,580
database.

79
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,430
And I think the cleanest way to do that is with Ajax.

80
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,530
So you don't have a save button, nothing like that.

81
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,760
You just toggle the switch.

82
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,920
It makes the change behind the scenes and then pops a little alert here that says, hey, the service

83
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,510
has been added and made active or whatever it is, we'll give some kind of success message for turning

84
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,860
it on and turning it off.

85
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,250
And we'll take care of that in the next lecture.
