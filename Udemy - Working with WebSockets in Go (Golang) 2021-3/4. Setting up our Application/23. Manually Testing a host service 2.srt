1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,820
So we're at the point now where we have this nice check now button and when we click on it, we actually

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,580
do get some valid JSON back from the server.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,710
So we know that everything is wired up correctly.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,430
And what we want to have happen next is when I actually click on this check now button, in our case,

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,280
what should happen is it should try to check for the status of a nonexistent server because we don't

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,130
have anything listening on the port AT&amp;T for localhost.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,240
So it should send back a message saying there is a problem.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,820
So we're moving from pending status to a problem status and we'll get a message up here.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,710
This road should disappear from this table and it should get added to this table for problem services.

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,950
So that'll be quite a few steps before we can make that happen.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,850
But let's get started.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,330
But before I forget, let's change it so that when I roll my my mouse over this check now button, it

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,190
actually changes to a pointer because that's a little more attractive and a little more useful in terms

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,080
of visual feedback.

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,970
And it's really easy.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,900
So let's go to our hosts file.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,990
And at the very top, I'm just going to create a new class called Pointer, a new CSS class, and all

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,990
it's going to give us is the cursor.

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:20,740
Is pointer, and then when I go down to my pending tab, which is way down here, there's pending where

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,000
I have spane class badge, badge, BGU Secondary or B.G. Secondary.

21
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:30,940
We'll just add a pointer to this when we go back to here and reload this page and go to the pending

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,270
tab.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,420
Now, when I roll over this, it should change to a pointer and it does.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,610
OK, so let's get started on the actual code to make this happen.

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,610
And if you recall, I wrote some comments, so underperformed checks don't go.

26
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,320
I have a bunch of comments here.

27
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,310
Get the whole service.

28
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,480
I know I have to do that.

29
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,980
I may have to get the host.

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,940
I'm not sure yet.

31
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,850
Then I want to test the service that I want to create an actual Jason file with the appropriate data

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,920
in it and send the response back.

33
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,530
So this will be the Jason that we're going to create.

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,310
So I'll just move it up here underneath the appropriate comment.

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
And let's look at the first step, get the host service.

36
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, I'm pretty sure if I look at my repository repository, Dongo, I actually don't have a method

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,440
that gets a host service yet.

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,910
So we need to go right that.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:25,720
So I will open up a repository DB repo host, underscore PostgreSQL Dot to go or create a new function

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:34,360
func and it'll have the receiver of type pointer to postgrads DB repo and I will call it get host service

41
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:43,630
by idea and it will take one parameter ID, which is an ID and it will return a model, a model staut

42
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,150
host service and potentially an error.

43
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:53,560
OK, so as I usually do, I'm going to come up here and copy my contacts code so I don't make a typographical

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,450
error and I'll paste it in here and we want to write a query.

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:06,250
So query is assign the value of and let's go look at our database and make sure we get all the appropriate

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,790
columns.

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:15,850
So connect to localhost, go to my localhost, find vigilante, and we're looking at host services right

48
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,960
here and we'll look at the structure of that.

49
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,020
So I want to get the idy, the host idy in the service idee, OK?

50
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,930
Select.

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:34,990
And I'm going to use an alias, thought I'd start poster ID, service ID and I'm using an alias because

52
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,780
I'm going to join the services table in a moment.

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,740
Active schedule, no schedule unit and just not active.

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,890
Hey, just up schedule no.

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:55,030
And on the next line extorts schedule unit and then last check and status created out and updated at

56
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,530
last check.

57
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,040
I've got to put the house in there.

58
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,340
His status has created at HHS, updated at.

59
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,410
And I'm not going to put a couple of blank lines in there from hosting services.

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:32,740
Yes, and then I'm on a left join services s on escort service ID equals Estcourt ID.

61
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:42,240
And then I'll need to wear clause where ID equals dollar, sign one, and up here I want to join the

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,640
services table, so I'm going to definitely get the ID, Estcourt ID and let's go see what else is in

63
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,570
the services table.

64
00:04:50,620 --> 00:05:02,090
Service name, active icon, escort service name escort, active as icon and create an updated ESTA

65
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,200
created at and updated app.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,110
So let's just make sure this query works.

67
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,180
I'm going to copy this.

68
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,160
See what I have in the host services table.

69
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,430
And the content is I have one with an idea of one, so let's just make sure this query works the way

70
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,510
we want it to and change this to a one and execute.

71
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,110
Perfect.

72
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,480
OK, so that query is correct.

73
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:34,120
Now we need to create a variable sort of type models, dot host service in order to hold this information.

74
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:42,920
Then we query our database row, assign the value of IMDB, dot, query, row, context, query, row

75
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:50,210
context and in our context hender a query and handed ID and then we scan.

76
00:05:50,210 --> 00:06:00,590
This error is assign the value of Rodon scan and we just scan into our newly created variable and present

77
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,890
ID and I'll duplicate that a bunch of times.

78
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,250
So HSR ID, host ID, service ID.

79
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,200
And next comes active.

80
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,460
Active.

81
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,390
And then schedule no, and I'm not using all this stuff, but I might use this query somewhere else,

82
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,370
so I may as well get all the information right now.

83
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,360
Schedule unit.

84
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,630
Last check and a few more duplications.

85
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,050
Status.

86
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,310
Created at.

87
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,650
Updated that and a few more duplications.

88
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:56,850
I've worked into the service now, so service dot ID and I'll delete these and duplicate this just to

89
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,860
avoid some more typographical errors.

90
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,410
So after service Erevia service name.

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,240
Then we get active.

92
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,350
Then we get Ikon and created and updated at.

93
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:26,640
Now we'll check for an error, if error is not equal to nil, then I'll just return and the error and

94
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,570
along the error to.

95
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:36,240
Logged print line error, and if everything worked, we get past this and we just return our panel.

96
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,020
OK, so let's copy this.

97
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,570
Signature go to our repository.

98
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,940
And pasted in here.

99
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:48,820
Perfect.

100
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,120
Now we go back to our perform checks and now we can actually get the hose service, so I'll create a

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:04,050
new variable X and error, and that is a sign the value of repo DB get host serviced by ID.

102
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,470
And what I want here is host service ID, which I grab from the parameter right up here.

103
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,990
So let's make sure this works by checking for an error.

104
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:20,360
If error is not equal to nil, all I do is logged up print line error and return.

105
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:26,250
And again, you're going to use more robust error checking in actual code and then just to make sure

106
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:35,730
this works, let's just say log print line service name is and we should be able to get that from service

107
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,690
dot service name.

108
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,300
And if that works, I know my database query is working and giving information back to my handler.

109
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,960
So I will stop my application, start my application.

110
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:57,670
He returned a few times, go back to my Web browser, reload this, go to the pending tab and click

111
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,270
on check now.

112
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,940
So this came back all right.

113
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,370
And in my log file, service name is HTP.

114
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,730
That is exactly what I'm looking for.

115
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,150
OK, so that step is done in the next step.

116
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,220
We we may not have to get the host.

117
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,620
I'm going to leave that comment there for now and in the next lecture will write some code that actually

118
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,970
tests the service.
