1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,710
So we have a couple of tables now, we have our host table, our services table and our host services

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,170
table, and we need to set up some models that allow us to map the information that we'll have in the

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,860
database with our go code.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,070
And that's pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,880
So let's go back to our idee and let's open up this package that's in the root level of our application,

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,950
inside the internal folder, inside the model's folder.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,730
And I'm going to open model Stocco.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,000
And here you see, we already have a couple of models.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,310
We have one for users and one for preferences.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,110
And we're not using the preferences yet, but we'll get to that eventually.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,620
So we need to set up some new ones.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,340
So we'll set up one for host type post, which is just a struct.

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,510
And everything inside that struct will correspond to what we have in our house table.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,070
So let's have a look at that and let's look at the structure for it.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,740
So it has an I.D. and a host name.

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,790
So let's add those ID.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:06,270
We'll just that'll just be an aunt and our host name, which will be a string.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,290
And then we had our canonical name, which will also be a string.

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:22,680
And what else do we have you URL, IP and IP version six, your URL String IP, which is the IP address,

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,630
which we might not use, but we might say we may also put it in their IP version six.

21
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,010
That will also be a string.

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,200
And what else do we have.

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:40,830
Location, operating system and active location, which is just a string OS for operating system, which

24
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:53,190
will be a string and active created an updated and active that will be an int created that which is

25
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,100
of time, time and updated at which is also of time.

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,790
Time.

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,630
OK, so let's give it a comment.

28
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:15,940
Host is the model for hosts.

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:27,280
OK, now we need one for services type services, also a struct, and it will have an ID for sure,

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,610
which is an ENT and it will also have created out and update it out.

31
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,860
So I'll copy those and paste them down in here.

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,150
Now let's see what else we have in their services.

33
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,380
So that has an idea.

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:52,730
Service name at an active service name, which will be a string active, which will be an ENT.

35
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,190
And an icon, which is just a.

36
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,030
OK, let's give that a comment.

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,610
Services.

38
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:16,130
Is the model for services and are third one is how services type hosted services.

39
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,600
I'll just call it host service struct.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,710
That will have an ID for sure.

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,850
And we'll have a creative created and updated out for sure, so let's put those in there and let's see

42
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,070
what else is in their host services right there.

43
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,970
So hosted in-service day ID

44
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:45,480
in.

45
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:55,300
And those are our foreign keys that allow us to determine which services exist for a given hope host,

46
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:06,430
active schedule, no active input schedule, no.

47
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,390
What is that?

48
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,940
It's an int.

49
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:25,730
Schedule unit, which is a string, so that would be like three minutes for for number and unit and

50
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,840
last check,

51
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,900
which will be a time time.

52
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,730
OK, so there's our host services.

53
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,340
And let's give that a comment is the model for hosting services.

54
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,820
OK, so now we have models set up for all of these things.

55
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,920
Now let's think about if we've missed anything.

56
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,430
We have all the information for our host and we absolutely need to know its ID so we can find it in

57
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,390
the database, its host hostname, which is just a string, something we can refer to.

58
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,010
So it makes sense to us.

59
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,940
We know which server we're looking at, canonical name.

60
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,120
We absolutely need that.

61
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,220
That's its domain name.

62
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,660
It's your URL.

63
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,600
How do we get to that?

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,950
If it's a website that it's HTP or HDB followed by whatever the URL is to get to it, IP and IP version

65
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,520
six.

66
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,260
We may not use those, but we might if we don't have a hostname, a real canonical name, for example,

67
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,800
we won't be checking by IP or IP version six location OS active.

68
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,000
I think we have everything you need for our hosts there.

69
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,160
What about our services now?

70
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,440
Services is the table that's just going to list the services we want to check.

71
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,180
So a given service in this table is not tied to a service, a particular host.

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,940
We do that in the host service table, but we have an ID so we can find in the database a name that's

73
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,900
descriptive so we know what we're monitoring, whether it's active or not.

74
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,520
Sure, an icon.

75
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,470
We're just going to use that for display, which we'll get to when we start building the necessary pages.

76
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,380
That seems to be everything we need here.

77
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,030
What about host services?

78
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:15,580
So I need some means of determining whether or not a service is up or down or in a morning state or

79
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,830
not yet checked, whatever it might be.

80
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:25,510
So what we have here is an ID, a host ID and a service ID and these to allow us to link services to

81
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,280
hosts using foreign keys.

82
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,610
Active makes sense how often we check it.

83
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:37,000
When we last checked it, I think we need one more thing and that would be the status, whether it's

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,430
up or down and that can be an A..

85
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,270
It could be a string.

86
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,470
It could be anything we want.

87
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:51,550
I think I'm just going to make it a string and that string will be OK or healthy for the service is

88
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:59,170
fine warning if it's in a warning state problem if it's in a problem state or pending if it's pending,

89
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,700
we could use anything we wanted.

90
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,810
We could actually have another table called status and use foreign keys to link them together.

91
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,850
But for the purposes of what we're trying to do in this course, I think just using a string is sufficient

92
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,380
for our purposes for the moment.

93
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:18,580
Now, we've added this to our model, but it doesn't exist in our actual database table.

94
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,200
So we need to run another migration.

95
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,600
So I'm make sure I'm in the root level of my directory.

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,080
I am.

97
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,530
And now I want to add a column to this particular table so I'll generate a migration.

98
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:41,950
So to generate fiz add status to host services table and that will allow me to have my two new migrations.

99
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,000
So let's open them up.

100
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,620
We'll go to our migration's.

101
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,130
And find the two that we've just added and I'll look at the up table first and the syntax to add it

102
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,180
is really straightforward.

103
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:03,200
Add column to the post services table and we'll call it status.

104
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,510
And it's a type of string and it's default.

105
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,060
We'll be just make it empty for now.

106
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,230
That way we'll never have a null value in there at all.

107
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,600
All right.

108
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,200
Actually, that's make it pending.

109
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,020
When we first add something to the table, its status should be pending because we want to run any checks

110
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,400
yet.

111
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,560
So there's our up migration and let's put our down migration in there as well.

112
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,770
And that's as simple as drop column from the host services table hosted services.

113
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,940
And the column I want to drop is status, and that should be it.

114
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,270
So let's try writing this migration so to migrate.

115
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,590
There it is, let's make sure it's in there, so I'll go back and reload this table and now I have status.

116
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,380
All right, so I'll add these to get.

117
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,830
And commit everything.

118
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:15,260
Create models and call them to host services and commit and push.

119
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,530
And push.

120
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,340
So the next step is to go create some database routines that allow us to add, edit and delete entries

121
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:39,240
to our hosts house services and services table, and we'll take care of that in the next lecture or

122
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,570
two.
