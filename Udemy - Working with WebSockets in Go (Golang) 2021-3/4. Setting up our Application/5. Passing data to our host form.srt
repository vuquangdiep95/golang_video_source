1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,490
So we have this form right now, and it seems to work pretty well if we go look at the actual house

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,710
form, there it is.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,000
And it the form displays properly are validation, appears to work properly.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:18,470
So what we want to do now is to think about how we're going to handle hosts and this form when we're

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,170
creating a new host the very first time we display this form.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,910
So this part right here before any validation has taken place.

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,710
Let me go back to the hosts and say new host.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,860
We don't actually want these tabs to show up at all because there are no services for a host, because

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,390
there's no entry in the database right now.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,860
We just want that first tab to show up.

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:47,480
So what we need to do is to make a decision when we're displaying this form, if it's a new host, don't

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,040
display these these tabs.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,960
If it is an existing host, then do display these tabs and also populate this form with data.

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:00,920
So let's go back to our code and let's find our roots and let's find the route that displays a host.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,240
And it's this one mux.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:10,190
Get host some ID and it will be zero if it's a new host or it'll be the ID for that entry in the host

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,360
table if it's if it's an existing host and that's this handler.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,530
So let's look at that right here.

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,950
All we're doing right now is rendering a page.

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,810
And what we want to do instead is to get the ID from the euro.

21
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,470
And that's pretty straightforward.

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,710
We can just say ID or potentially an error is equal to stir conv from the strings package.

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:55,140
Sture conv thought a twohy, and that will the stricken package will actually take our parameter and

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,490
which we get as a string and pass it to an aunt and we can get that from CZI dot get are you Earl Perram?

25
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,400
And that takes the request and it takes the key.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,310
And the key is ID like this.

27
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,280
I think it's just ID.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,090
Yeah that's it.

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,670
I'm going to ignore the error in this case.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,990
Of course in production code you would want to handle any, any exceptions.

31
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,910
But in this case we're more concerned with WebSocket than we are with writing web applications.

32
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,890
So let's just see if we get that.

33
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,220
I will say log print line ID is and its ID.

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,430
Now, let's make sure that that's actually the ID from the roots.

35
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,680
Yeah, it's just ID, so I'll stop the application.

36
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,050
Start the application.

37
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,940
Hit return a few times, just so there's some blank lines there.

38
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:54,190
I'll go back to my Web browser and I will go to hosts and new host and in my log file, it says the

39
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,940
ID is zero.

40
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,390
But if I change that to, say, 10 and it return the ideas temp.

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
So we're getting the ID perfect.

42
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,970
So let's go back to her handler.

43
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,830
And let's make a decision here, I'll get rid of this log file, because I know that's working properly

44
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:17,270
will say if it is greater than zero, then I want to get the host from the database otherwise.

45
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:26,530
Put an else in there else, and what I want to do here is create an empty post.

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,870
Now I can do that really easily.

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,730
I can create the value right here.

48
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,200
I can save her host, which I'll call H and it's of type models host.

49
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,840
And down here, I need to get it from the database, if the ID is greater than zero, so I'll just use

50
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,800
the variable H in here and I'm not going to do that right now because the database function doesn't

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,610
exist at the moment.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,750
Otherwise, I don't even need this because at this point I already have my H variable.

53
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:04,030
So now I need to pass some values to the to the template and I can do that by saying Vires is equal

54
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,490
to make jet var map.

55
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,870
And all I need to do is to add this to my my this, this variable to my verse.

56
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:21,790
So Verstraete set and the name will be host and the value is H and then I pass this variable Verve's

57
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,690
to my template right here.

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,330
So if we do this properly and we can, we can actually check this by saying, well I'll just put a value

59
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,660
in here.

60
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,810
So I will say H dot.

61
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,150
Hostname equals some host.

62
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,700
OK, so now I've created the variable, my ID will be zero when I display the page.

63
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,820
So this whatever is in here wouldn't get executed.

64
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,960
There's nothing in there now, so it doesn't matter anyway.

65
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,990
I'm setting the hostname to some host and I'm passing that to the template now in the template host

66
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,380
jet.

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,630
I actually want to display the hostname, so I'll get out of the part of the former.

68
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,770
I display the host name.

69
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,160
And what I want to do, first of all, is get that value from the template.

70
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,030
So all I have to do are for my template data.

71
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,760
So all I have to do is find the value and say that is equal to a hostname.

72
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,430
And that should work once I stop the application, start the application.

73
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:33,000
Go back to my application to my Web browser, choose hosts, choose new host, and I have what do I

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,700
have here?

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,280
Default variables, tax danger.

76
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,130
OK, there's something missing there.

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,240
Let's find that.

78
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:47,950
Handlers host jet, and the value I'm getting here is dot hostname.

79
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,850
Right, it's called host.

80
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,300
Let's go back here and reload this, and there it is, some host and I could do the same thing for everything

81
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:01,650
else.

82
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,640
Now, obviously, I don't want to have some name in there, so let me go back to my handler and get

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,510
rid of this line.

84
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,160
So the next thing to do is to make sure that the tabs only show up if for ID of greater than zero,

85
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,570
so we can do that really easily.

86
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,400
We can come in here and put in a statement.

87
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,760
We can say if post ID is greater than zero.

88
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:35,690
And down here, put an end and we'll just have this in so it's more readable and we'll copy this line

89
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,840
and we'll do the same thing with all of the other tips.

90
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,680
So that would be after this form.

91
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,390
Right here.

92
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:56,750
We're not going to have services or any of the other tabs if it's a new host, so I should be able to

93
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:04,400
have this image so it's more readable, save this and reload this page by going to host just to make

94
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,840
sure we're getting everything current, a new host, and now we just have the one tab.

95
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,780
And that's exactly what I want at this point.

96
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,160
So now that we have this form displaying properly for new hosts where there are no services yet, the

97
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,010
next step is to write the necessary database handler to insert a host into the database.

98
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,440
Take us back to this page and show those taps.

99
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,750
So we'll take care of that in the next lecture.
