1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,430
So we need to write a more general function to update any of the fields in our host services table,

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,000
so I'm in my host underscore PostgreSQL go file.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,800
And as I said last time, we already have one that updates a host service, but it just updates the

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,640
active status.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:23,080
But I can use that as a starting point by copying and pasting it and just changing the name to update

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:33,380
post service and fix the comment, updates the post service updates, a host service and the host service.

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,430
Now it's a EHO service in the database.

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,810
And we're not going to take three cents, we will take a IHSS, which is a type model host service,

9
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,300
and will return an error, if any.

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,680
So all that's going to change here.

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,640
Let's just delete this part time.

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,040
And I'll just update this query, so we want to update his services and I'll have it in and we want

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,600
to set not just active, we'll fix those in a moment.

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,820
Where?

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,110
Host where ID equals and get I don't know what the dollar sign is going to be, so I'll just leave it

16
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,890
empty for a moment.

17
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,260
OK, so we want to set.

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,710
And get rid of this, I up with the set up there.

19
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,180
And we're going to fix what fields or update what fields, I'm going to put them all in there because

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,730
I may use this same method at some point later or in the future.

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,490
So let's go to post Toco.

22
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,680
We have Idy Hoshide inservice.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,770
We don't care about IDs or host IDs, service ideate active.

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:51,770
So host I.D. equals dollar sign one service ID equals dollar sign to active equals dollar sign three.

25
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,120
I'll go to the next line.

26
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:05,750
After activity of schedule number and schedule unit schedule number equals dollar sign for schedule

27
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,030
unit equals dollar sign five.

28
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,000
Then last check and status.

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:27,110
Last check equals dollar sign, six status equals dollar sign seven and updated X equals dollar sign

30
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,500
eight.

31
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:38,670
Which makes this night so let's just fix our query or exit context statement to say we want to get this

32
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,420
from HFS dot and the first one is posted.

33
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,810
Now, duplicate this a few times, service ID active.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,050
Schedule No.

35
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,540
Schedule unit and duplicate that again and again and again.

36
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,960
Last check.

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,050
Status.

38
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,940
And update it up and the last thing is ID and make sure that everything's going correct here, perfect.

39
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,520
OK, now we could, of course, just get rid of this method altogether and use this one instead, and

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,510
it would work just fine.

41
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,550
But this isn't hurting anything, so I'll leave that there.

42
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,390
So I'll copy the signature of this method or this function and put it in my repository, paste it in

43
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,870
here and I'll go back to my perform checks.

44
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,270
And this is the point right here where I want to update the whole service in the database with status

45
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,710
if changed and last check.

46
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,250
And as you know, we already have the hoster service.

47
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,590
We grabbed it right here and we already have the new status and we know the time that it's going to

48
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,040
change.

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,300
It's just time now.

50
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,850
So I can simply say dot status equals new status.

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,250
Just set that value.

52
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:10,110
HSA updated at equals time now because this is when we're doing it and call this new function error

53
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:19,170
as a sign the value of repo DB update host service right here and hand it my HS because I just overwritten

54
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,520
the values I pulled from the database with this information and just check for an error.

55
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,090
So I'll copy this and paste it right here and that should do it.

56
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,200
So let's stop our database or application.

57
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,100
I guess mine's not running.

58
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,730
I'll clear it.

59
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,050
I'll run my application.

60
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,540
And this should work and what should happen when I go back to my Web browser and reload this page and

61
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,980
I guess I have to log in again, so I'll organize it mean at example, dot com with the password of

62
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,970
password and save that or login.

63
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,970
So now when I go to my hosts and I go to my problems or pending when I check now, it should update

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,920
everything in the database.

65
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,310
Now I'll get a message up here.

66
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,840
Nothing else will change on the screen.

67
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,460
But when I go back to overview, I should see a problem service here and no pending service here.

68
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,480
Let's see if we got it right.

69
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,150
So pending.

70
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,460
And it says air connecting and nothing else changed on this page, and that's OK, because I'm going

71
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,330
to change the contents of this page using Web sockets in a little while.

72
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,840
But I should be able to go to overview and see that now I have a problem service and now I have no pending

73
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,460
services.

74
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,640
And when I go to localhost and I look at spending, it should be gone.

75
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,450
And it is.

76
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,910
And if I look at problems, it's here now.

77
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,590
And this is exactly what I want.

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,220
Now, I have some things to clean up on this screen and these other two tabs as well.

79
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,770
I need to format the date properly.

80
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,050
And actually my last check.

81
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,730
Let's go look at the database.

82
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,580
Last check.

83
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,700
Oh, because I did an update.

84
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,300
Last check.

85
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,930
That was silly.

86
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,760
Let me go back here.

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,140
I make these mistakes all the time and so will you.

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,330
So I need to go back to my form check.

89
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,790
And here it's not just updated at its last check.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,950
That's equal to time now as well.

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,210
You notice that, didn't you?

92
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,810
And you're laughing at me right now, aren't you?

93
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,520
That's OK.

94
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,720
I've been left up for.

95
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,760
So let's stop this, start this.

96
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,960
And I should be able to get that field update just by doing the check on the same screens.

97
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,240
Let me reload the page, go to problems, check now and again.

98
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,740
It didn't change on this page because I'm going to do that using Web sockets.

99
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,130
But if I reload this page, last check should now have the correct value in it, and it does.

100
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,140
So we need to format the this page a little bit better and we can do that really quickly right now.

101
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,420
And I'll do one tab and you can do the rest at your leisure because it's fairly straightforward.

102
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:59,240
Let's go to Chad and I'll hide my menu, split my screen just so I can see things a little better.

103
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,110
I'll find the pending part, which is right here.

104
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,450
And this is the kind of change I want to make in problems.

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,650
So let's go to problems.

106
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,240
This is just so I can see things a little more easily.

107
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,640
I do this all the time and you probably do, too.

108
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,910
So this is going to have the badge secondary.

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:27,460
It's also going to have the pointer class and let's copy these and replace that in that is last check

110
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,060
so I can delete this and paste it in there.

111
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,950
OK, and I think that's it for that.

112
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,410
Now I have the service icon, so let's get the service icon, copy that, and that goes before the service

113
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:46,670
name.

114
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,470
And I want to come back here and reload this page and look at problems there.

115
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,690
That all looks a little bit better.

116
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,270
Still don't have a message here right now.

117
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,400
And I may drop this column altogether because it's not terribly useful information at the moment.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,520
But when I first started doing it, I thought maybe I'll have a message.

119
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:08,010
I'm not sure that it's going to make it to the very last version of this code, but I'll leave it there

120
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,540
for the moment.

121
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,400
So you'll probably want to do the same thing, just kind of take the same content and also put it in

122
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,560
the warning services and put it in the healthy services modified as necessary.

123
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,410
And I'll leave that as an exercise for you.

124
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,800
I'll do it myself after a record this lecture, and it'll be available to you on the source code for

125
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,370
this lecture.

126
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,230
But it's pretty straightforward and I don't think you need to watch me making those changes.

127
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,560
OK, so we'll pick it up in the next lecture.
