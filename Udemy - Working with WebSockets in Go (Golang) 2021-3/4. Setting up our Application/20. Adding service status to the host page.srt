1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,030
So hopefully you didn't have any trouble finishing up these three screens, and it's pretty straightforward,

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,410
and if you looked at the source that I posted at the end of the last lecture, you'll notice that I

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,330
did make one minor change and it's literally one little bit in the school query.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,110
So this is the get services by status method found inside the host underscore PostgreSQL go file.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,960
And all I did was add this little bit at the end.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,950
So when we have more than one service, of course you want them to be ordered in some meaningful way.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,780
So I said order by hostname and service name.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,460
And that way when we have more than one host or more than one service, things won't be arranged just

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,060
randomly.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,880
They'll have some sensible order.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,460
So that's the one change we made there.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,680
So now if we go back and look at this, this page looks good.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,750
We have one service with one host and it displays everything just the way that it should.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,090
But if we go back here, I don't like this.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,470
There's nothing here.

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,720
And this table has no information whatsoever.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,990
And it's just cosmetically it's not that attractive.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,600
So let's go fix that up and then we'll move on to the next step in this project.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,560
And this is really easy.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,700
So let me go to my code and let me look at my views folder, which is right here, and we'll start with

21
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,100
healthy.

22
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,120
So at this point, I'm ranging through the services and displaying them right here in the template.

23
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,320
And if there's nothing in there, of course, none of this code gets executed.

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,240
Therefore, we just have an empty body so we can improve this just by saying and the simple if statement

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,320
if Lenn of services is greater than zero.

26
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,310
And put an ELT's here.

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,860
And put an end here and let's just tab things around so it's a little more readable.

28
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,680
So if we have at least one thing in our services variable, then this code gets executed.

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:01,790
Otherwise we'll just put it in one table row with one table column that has a call span of one, two,

30
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,950
three, four, four, no services.

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,540
And that's all we need to do.

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,750
So let me that was the healthy one.

33
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,960
Now let's get to the next one, which would be spending.

34
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,370
If Lynn of Services is greater than zero.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,270
ELT's.

36
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:43,170
And I'll just have this over go back to my healthy copy, this one section here and pasted in.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,620
And have it in, so that's pending now problems, same idea.

38
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,400
If Lenn of services is greater than zero.

39
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,600
ELT's.

40
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,120
Pasting my code.

41
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,230
And.

42
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,070
And I think there's one more warning.

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,220
If one of services is greater than zero.

44
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,210
Beltz, Paiste and.

45
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,430
And this over.

46
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,610
And tab this over and make sure everything is done properly.

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,600
So let's just go have a look at this overview.

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,550
There should be one row in this table that says no services and that looks much better, not just a

49
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,390
cosmetic thing.

50
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,580
I just like it much better.

51
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,250
And let's make sure the pending actually displays properly and it does.

52
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,310
OK, so that's simple.

53
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,280
Now, the next thing I want to do, and this is where things start to get a little more complicated,

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,440
but not too much when I look at my host.

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,910
This is correct.

56
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,040
This is correct.

57
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,560
And these are empty.

58
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,290
There's nothing in them.

59
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,170
And we want to actually display all of the healthy services here, all of the warning services here,

60
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,910
all of the problems and all of the pending.

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,570
And I also want to allow the user when they're looking, say, for example, at the pending services

62
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,880
or the problems or any of these for a list, the service, and I'll have a button beside it that allows

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,570
me to check.

64
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,820
Now, that will actually fire off a request in the background, do a check of that service.

65
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,090
If it's not changed status, give them some message to that.

66
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,020
That indicates that.

67
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,660
But if it has changed status, what's going to happen down the road is will remove the entry from the

68
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,360
current tab, display an alert or a message to the user saying that the status has changed from something

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,650
to something else and then add a row in the appropriate tab.

70
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,280
So for impending and we say check now and it moves from, say, pending to problems, it deletes the

71
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,140
entry from the table here, adds it to the table here and displays an alert up here.

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,450
So let's get started doing that.

73
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,260
The first thing we're going to have to do, of course, is figure out how we populate each of these

74
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,430
tabs with the information.

75
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:25,230
So let's go back to our roots file roots and find the part where we're showing a host, which is right

76
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,990
here, handler's repost.

77
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,220
So what we're doing here is we're grabbing the ID from the URL.

78
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,010
We're creating an empty models host.

79
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,340
We're getting the host from the database if it's greater than zero.

80
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,080
And we're going to assume that's the case here right now and that calls get hosted by ID.

81
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:52,230
So when we go to get hosted by ID under the Postgrads File, which is in the repository in DB Repo and

82
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,360
it's called Host Underscore Postgrads.

83
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,650
Let's find get hosted by ID right there.

84
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,830
So what are we getting here.

85
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,570
We're getting the basic host information.

86
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,900
We're scanning that into our variable, then we're getting all the services for the host and this includes

87
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,230
all of the services that have any status.

88
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,930
So we're having them all there and it also includes inactive services.

89
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,840
Perfect.

90
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,970
This will give us everything we need.

91
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:25,740
So we already have enough information that we can go to our hosts file host jet right here, host Cingular

92
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,400
Jet.

93
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,510
And let's do the let's do the pending one first because we have some content in there.

94
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:42,480
So let's create a t a div of class equals row and then a div of class equals call and let's create a

95
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,700
table so we'll create a table.

96
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,850
Table class equals.

97
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,250
Table, table striped.

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,080
And give it a head and think about what information we want in there.

99
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,480
Well, we definitely want the TIAR.

100
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,350
We want it.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,420
We want the service, the service name.

102
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,690
We want the last check.

103
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,350
And we'll have a message which will be empty for right now as we have nothing display in that, but

104
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,280
we'll get to that later on.

105
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,990
So this gives us our table heading and then we want our table body.

106
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:37,410
And we want to display information again only if there is a status that is of the status pending so

107
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,960
we can do it like this range.

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,060
Host Dot, and I think it's called host services, but let me make sure in your models.

109
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,500
So host has hosted services, yes, plural, so let's go back to our House page.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,880
Hosted services and.

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,170
Let's just display the services here.

112
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,770
So the first one would be a tiara, because we're going to loop through this one item at a time and

113
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,700
then a TV, and then we want the service name, which I believe.

114
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,890
Let's just go back to our models and make sure wherever they're here, we are host services, a hosted

115
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,740
service holds a service that has a service name.

116
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,540
So back to host.

117
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,910
So that would be Dort service, not service name.

118
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,610
Clothes are curly brackets.

119
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,830
Let's just make sure that works.

120
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:37,200
I'll just put in two empty rows so it satisfies that requirement and go back and go back to her overview,

121
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,500
look at our hosts and look at pending.

122
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,880
And that should list one service and it does HDP last check and message.

123
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,640
OK, so we know what that has that information.

124
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,920
I probably should give it to that pending content, but let's go down here and change that pending content.

125
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,630
Just delete it.

126
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,030
And just before the just after the column is opened, we'll put a little heading in there each three

127
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,910
and we'll say pending services.

128
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,800
And we already have last checked.

129
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,340
So let's just stick that in there as it looks right now.

130
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,940
Last check.

131
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,480
Reload.

132
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,280
Pending.

133
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,670
OK, that needs to be pushed down to maybe a little bit smaller, so last check, OK?

134
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,300
That's my default value and I'm not really happy with the displaying that way, but I'll take care of

135
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,530
that.

136
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,330
I have some functions available to us that will format this more appropriately, but it looks like it's

137
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,340
actually getting the information the way that we want.

138
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,140
And the problem with that, of course, is that this is going to list all of the services, whether

139
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,130
they're pending or not.

140
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,480
And we don't want to do that.

141
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,990
We actually only want to list the pending services.

142
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,130
So first of all, let's push this down.

143
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,020
I'll make this an effort to make it smaller.

144
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,660
Class equals empty, say, three, reload this pending.

145
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,250
Class equals PT three padding top three doesn't seem to be working.

146
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,900
That works better.

147
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,900
OK, so we only want to display things here that are actually pending so we can just do it like this

148
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,590
if.

149
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,520
DOT's status equals spending.

150
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:26,500
And then do an end here, not the most efficient way in the world, but it'll work, this should actually

151
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,100
display the information again and it should include the pending one and it does.

152
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,050
OK, so let's get to getting us started.

153
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,780
Let's just quickly duplicate that.

154
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,740
All of this information starting with here.

155
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,410
Copy that.

156
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:50,990
And go back up to problem content and just paste it in here and only after changes this problem and

157
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,160
this to problem.

158
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,430
OK, let's just make sure that's working.

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,310
Reload this and that should show nothing.

160
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,690
OK, so that worked.

161
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,070
We'll just have this in.

162
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,790
And to have that in good, so there's only one of thing I want to want to put here, and that is status,

163
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,730
so I want to have that check now Button.

164
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,880
So where am I going to put that?

165
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,450
Let's go back to our pending service issue and I should put a check now button right there.

166
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,780
So let's do that.

167
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,520
So after the service name.

168
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:42,530
I want to put a little a HSF equals go nowhere, so JavaScript void zero, which will make the Celenk

169
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,540
but won't go anywhere.

170
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,090
And we want to say unclick or just say class.

171
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,570
We'll give it a class now.

172
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,200
We'll make it or not.

173
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:00,080
Click on click equals check now and then the ID of the host service, which would be Dort ID because

174
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,750
we're looping through host services here.

175
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,000
We know, we know, we have the ID and we'll just say check now and we'll format this in a little,

176
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,830
a little more nicely in a moment.

177
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,300
OK, I think I have that.

178
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,720
All right.

179
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,690
And down here we need to put a check now function so I'll just make an empty function function check

180
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,930
now and the ID and it does nothing.

181
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,790
I'll just say console log clicked.

182
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,700
Check now.

183
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,660
OK, let's go reformat this a reload this, open our JavaScript console, go to pending and we should

184
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,160
have a check now button and we do.

185
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,860
And when I click on it, uncaught reference.

186
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,340
I got a typo in there somewhere.

187
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,320
Let's go fix that.

188
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,760
Oh, yes, probably want to close that there.

189
00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:00,370
That looks a little better, let's close this and apparently I don't have IP running, so I'll start

190
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,080
that up to avoid those errors.

191
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:12,630
Now go back and reload this page to make sure everything's current, go to pending and click on Check

192
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:12,960
now.

193
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:24,400
That looks better, and if I clear this check now, check now, OK, so that all seems to be working.

194
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:31,150
Let's make this a little more attractive and I can probably just make that a button or a small let's

195
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,840
go like this.

196
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,040
Let's go.

197
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,610
Spane class equals badge.

198
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:48,780
Vague outline, secondary, I think that will do it and put this one down here and let's see how that

199
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,140
looks.

200
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,230
Reloads tending, OK?

201
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,190
Apparently, that's not a background, so we'll have to change it to something else.

202
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:07,640
Let's change it to, well, info, see what that looks like, reload pending, that's not going to work.

203
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,790
B.G. Dash.

204
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,300
Say, secondary, PJI secondary.

205
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,960
Let's try that.

206
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,720
Still pretty dark.

207
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,720
OK.

208
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,150
What it doesn't need to be an if at all.

209
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,110
Let's just take this on Klickitat there.

210
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,310
Put it up here, get rid of the AI altogether.

211
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,260
And Unclipped needs a print this earth quote after it.

212
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,140
OK, Alex, right, let's try that.

213
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,390
That looks better.

214
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,640
OK, so that will give me my check now button, and I probably want to add some success.

215
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,890
So when you roll over this, that it turns into a pointer.

216
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,440
But for now, this is sufficient for our purposes.

217
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,400
So that works there.

218
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,120
Let's just copy this little bit.

219
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,280
And add it to this one, so after the service name.

220
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,070
And it goes right here to have that, and so it looks a little better.

221
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:31,840
And that and so it looks a little bit better analysis, copy this entire range bid and add it to the

222
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,620
next one, which is warning content.

223
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,010
Actually, I want to copy the whole thing.

224
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,150
Div class equals row all the way down to here, so we're going to go to warning.

225
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,070
Which is right here.

226
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,850
Paste that in and make that morning services that make this morning.

227
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,570
OK, and healthy and paste that in there and change this to healthy.

228
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,210
And change this to healthy.

229
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,860
Let's make sure this all works appropriately and pending good problems, no problem.

230
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,600
Warning.

231
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,260
And healthy.

232
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,060
OK, so that's sufficient for our purposes right now.

233
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,120
This gets us started.

234
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,750
So now we know we can display all of the appropriate information.

235
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,150
So if I go back to my overview and look at pending services and click on localhost, it should take

236
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,590
me to the pending tab and have everything displaying as it should.

237
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,100
All right.

238
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,290
That's enough for this time in the next election.

239
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,570
We'll move on to the next step.
