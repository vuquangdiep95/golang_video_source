00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,380
So while I was recording this course go one point one six came out and go one point one six is a pretty

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,540
good upgrade with a lot of new features.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,250
And there's an article here on Long Rocket.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,570
This is a blog post called What's New and Go One Point one six.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,630
And I've posted a link to this in the course resources for this lecture.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,170
And there are very few changes required.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,180
And to be fair, if you don't do any of these changes, there's only two small ones we need to make.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,260
Everything will still work.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,300
But I think it's always a good idea to stay current with the language and to keep my code base up to

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,670
date with whatever changes have occurred in the language.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,540
So the part that interests us and we you scroll down this article all the way down to IOU til right

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,900
here, the IOU IOU still package is now deprecated and all they've done is they've left the existing

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,470
methods that are in the ideal package as part of the language.

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,690
But they've actually moved, the methods are copied, the methods to other places where they make more

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,100
sense.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,140
So the part that interests us are these methods right here and we're only using one of them.

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,120
So if you go to our code and just to be clear, if you make these changes without installing go one

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,070
point one six, your code is not going to work.

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,350
So the first step is to go update from go one point one five or whatever.

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,780
You have to go one point one six, then you make these changes.

21
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,480
So if you look at our code right over here, the only places where where we make a call to IOU till

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,480
there's only one place and it's in Pusher Go, which is found in internal handlers, pusher go.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:42,030
And it's this in my code, it's line 17 and all we need to do is to change IO util to IO and our updates

24
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,010
are imports should update and they did.

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,840
So that changes is necessary to make this current with go one point one six.

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,630
The other place is in my go modify.

27
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,060
I just changed the third line from go one point one five to go one point one six.

28
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,020
And assuming that you've installed go one point once a one point one six.

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,950
Life is good and those are the only changes required for our code base.
