1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,520
So now we want to insert a host into the database and I'm looking at the host jet file and there's a

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,000
few changes I need to make to this.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,530
First of all.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:10,740
Right.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,660
Here in the form method equals post action equals admin host zero.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,880
I don't want that to be zero.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,220
That's going to be the host side from the host variable that we're passing right here in the handler.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,890
So host right here.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,920
We get a we create an empty models host.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,470
Then later on we're going to grab it from the database.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,080
If it's it is greater than zero.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,390
Otherwise we're passing an empty host.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,420
So the ID will be whatever the ID of the model is, because we're storing it with a variable name host

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,700
here inversed set and in the host object, we can get access to that host variable just like this.

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,630
So that will give us the correct ID.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,390
And the other thing we want to do is to populate all of the content of that form with whatever's in

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,260
that host variable.

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,780
Now we've done it here in host hostname.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,780
We also want to get it in the canonical name.

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,730
So I'll post that in here and change that to canonical name and the euro will Paysite in here and that's

21
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,340
just set to you earlier.

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,380
And if I look at my models, I think I put it in all uppercase.

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,060
Yes, I did.

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:26,670
OK, and the same thing in the IP address, which is just called IP IP IP Version six.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,870
Not sure what I call that.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,770
Let's go find out.

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,010
IPV six, all caps, IPV six.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,800
And the location is just called location, so we'll just put host dot location.

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,730
The operating system is OS, host OS and the switch.

30
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,710
This doesn't have a value right now and it probably should.

31
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,970
So we need to put an if statement in here are actually no we don't.

32
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:02,250
We can just say value equals host dot active and that of course has to be in quotation marks.

33
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,390
So we'll put a quotation marks around that and get rid of the extra quote and save that.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,720
And this should all work.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,920
Is my application running?

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,310
Yes.

37
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,230
I'm going to stop it and start it, just to be sure.

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,790
And I'll go back to my Web browser and I'll go right to the hosts page, click on New Host and this

39
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,580
should have the ID of zero in the action.

40
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,990
So let's look for action.

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,940
And it does.

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,130
It has zero there and everything else is exactly as it should be.

43
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,020
So now I want to fill this form out.

44
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,560
I want to grab the data and I want inserted into the database.

45
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,840
So we need to create a database function.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,760
So let's go back to our code and let's go to the internal folder and then the repository folder and

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,440
look in the DB repo folder.

48
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,140
And inside of that, I'm going to create a new file.

49
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,100
And you go file, which I will call host Underscore Postgres Cual.

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,440
Don't go.

51
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,630
All right, so that creates a new one.

52
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,630
Yes, I want to add that to my repository.

53
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,360
So let's create a function and this is a database function.

54
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,890
And because it's a database using a repository, I actually pass it.

55
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,630
It has a receiver of I'll call it M Postgrads Postgres DB Repo, and this will be called insert host.

56
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,060
And it will take one parameter which I'll call H.

57
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,990
It's a type models host and it will return an event which will be the ID of the newly created record

58
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,790
and potentially an error.

59
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,770
OK, now, because this is a Web application, I tend to do this.

60
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,590
I use the contacts package and I'm going to create a variable called seatbacks and a variable called

61
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,780
Cancel and they will come from the contacts package.

62
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:01,380
And I want with time out because this is a web application and periodically things will go wrong.

63
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,990
Either the user will lose their connection to the Internet or they'll click cancel partway through a

64
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,070
transaction, whatever it is.

65
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,130
But I want it to time out after a while and we use the context with time out.

66
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,790
That method has two parameters.

67
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,790
The first one is just the background context, which is always available.

68
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,380
So context up background.

69
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,860
And the second one is how long do I want this to last?

70
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,990
Well, if it takes more than three seconds, then I want it to time out.

71
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,880
OK, so I've created that and now I need to defer the cancel.

72
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,480
In other words, when this function exits or three seconds past, get rid of the cancel.

73
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,590
So we'll defer the cancel.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
And that's of course a function.

75
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,360
So we'll do it like that.

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,230
Now we wrote a query.

77
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,550
Query is just a variable I'm creating and that's a sign the value of insert into hosts and what we want

78
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,130
to insert.

79
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,750
Well, let's go look at our database again, which I think I still have running right here.

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,140
Yes.

81
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,560
I don't want to insert the ID that will be handled automatically.

82
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:12,000
I want hostname a canonical name, so hostname canonical name, canonical name and then it is you URL,

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,430
IP and IP version six you url ip IP Version six, which I didn't have an underscoring did I know location

84
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:31,170
was an active location OS active and finally created an updated app created at an updated app.

85
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:40,440
And then on the next line I will put values and because this is Postgres we have to have the dollar

86
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,220
sign placeholder.

87
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,850
So dollar sign.

88
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,920
One dollar sign, two dollar sign three.

89
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,230
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

90
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,490
So I have a total of ten dollar sign for dollar sign.

91
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,990
Five dollar sign.

92
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,420
Six dollar sign.

93
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,830
Seven dollar sign.

94
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,630
Eight dollar sign.

95
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,940
Nine dollar sign ten.

96
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,880
And I want to return.

97
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,540
So returning the ID.

98
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,550
OK, so there's my query.

99
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:17,550
Now we need to create a new variable to store the ID that will become a successful insert.

100
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,130
I'll call that new ID and it'll be of type Int and now we just call our database.

101
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:31,920
Error is a sign the value of M which is my receiver and that has a member called DB and I want the method

102
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,670
built into DB called query row context and I pass it my contacts, which I created right up here in

103
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,110
the first line of this function and my query which I better spell.

104
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,470
Right, and then I'll put these on separate lines.

105
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,660
They're more readable, all the values, and these need to correspond to the same order that they're

106
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,270
called in the insert statement.

107
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:04,650
So the first one is H hostname and the second one is a canonical name and then short URL and then H

108
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:11,160
IP and then H IP version six H dot.

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,270
Location H os.

110
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:28,170
Not active, and then the last two older shoes, time now and then I'll duplicate that line, the current

111
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,410
time will be inserted into both created and updated.

112
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,000
So we do this and now we check for an error.

113
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,840
If error is not equal to nil, then what do I want to do?

114
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,010
I want to log the error.

115
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:47,160
So logged our print line error and I want to return the new ID, which will have no value.

116
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,060
So it'll be zero.

117
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,000
And the error which is erm.

118
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,040
And I missed something here.

119
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:01,720
Oh, yes, I got to scan the I.D., I got a scan into my.

120
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,940
That and that will take care of it, because postgrads actually doesn't work the way that, say, if

121
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,810
you're familiar with Maria Debe or Maisky.

122
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,500
Well, it's a little different the way that you get the created ID.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:21,220
But in postgrads, we need to Queretaro context and scan its return value into some variable, which

124
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,980
is what we're doing here.

125
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
And if I don't do that, it's not going to throw an error.

126
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:32,950
So now if we get past this, then all is well and we just return the new ID and nil for the error.

127
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,600
And let's give this a comment.

128
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:46,230
Inserts a host into the database now, because I'm using the repository pattern, which is a really

129
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,590
common one, and if you're not familiar with it, you should become familiar with it.

130
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,580
I actually have to add this method signature, this entire thing, the method name its parameters and

131
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,190
what it returns into this file repository.

132
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,480
Dacko So I'll create a new comment here posts and just paste that in.

133
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,470
Now if I stop the application and start it, I didn't need to do that yet, but I'm going to be doing

134
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,340
it in a minute so I may as well do it right now and go back to our handlers.

135
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,840
At this point, we want to insert a host into the database.

136
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:30,180
OK, so that means we need to read all the values from our post, put them into a model of type models,

137
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,830
dot host and then call our insert host function so we can create a new variable.

138
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:43,290
VAR hope for each is a type model host and we just start inserting values into it so we can say each

139
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,000
dot first name.

140
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,700
Actually let's do it this way first.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,110
Let's make sure that we get the IDs up here in the previous function, which is host, we grab the ID

142
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,360
from the, from the URL and we're going to do the same thing right here.

143
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,260
OK, so now I have the ID and I'm going to do the same kind of logic I do up here.

144
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:12,780
If ID is greater than zero, get the host from the database.

145
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,390
So what I'll do is read the host from the database, then overwrite the values from the post into this

146
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,610
and then call an update method that doesn't exist yet.

147
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,420
So we can't do that.

148
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,260
Otherwise we'll just populate this model host, which has to come before the IF statement because I'm

149
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,460
going to be using it in here.

150
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,830
We just populate its values.

151
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,810
So we'll do this the long way first and we'll clean up the code a little bit later on.

152
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,120
Right now, I just want to insert something into the database.

153
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,530
So what do what am I getting here?

154
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,610
I'm getting the hostname.

155
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:51,720
So h dot hostname is equal to we need to get it from a request.

156
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,730
So we be are dot.

157
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:06,440
Form dot get hostname, and this name here needs to match exactly what's on the host jet form and what

158
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,930
I'm calling it here in the host form is hostname perfect.

159
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,270
So back to our handlers.

160
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,450
So we get the hostname, then we get the canonical you URL.

161
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,200
So I'll just duplicate that line and changes to canonical name.

162
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,990
And this is called Canonical Name.

163
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,460
And then what's the next thing we get.

164
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,750
Let's just go look at our form here.

165
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:36,560
We get the URL that's called URL and in the models it's called URL uppercase.

166
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,890
Then we get the IP, which is called IP.

167
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,270
Then we get the IP version six, which is called IP Version six.

168
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:55,250
We make sure that's what it's called on the form here, IPV six and I'm using IPV six.

169
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:55,670
Good.

170
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,900
And the next thing is the location, the operating system and active.

171
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,160
So the location.

172
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,580
That's easy.

173
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,230
That's just a string location is called location.

174
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,530
OS is called OS and the last one is actually an ant, so I need to convert what I'm getting from my

175
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,330
form post, which always comes in the form string into an end, and I can do that pretty easily.

176
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,120
We'll just say active is a and potentially an error, which I'm going to ignore.

177
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,770
And again, in production you wouldn't know it.

178
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,130
But I'm not focusing on Web application development here.

179
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:37,650
I'm focusing on Web sockets and we need to jump to some hoops to get their Østergaard on a tour.

180
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,490
And what we're going to get is art form douget.

181
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,190
And the name of this is active.

182
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,000
So now I have a variable active and I can say H dot active is equal to active.

183
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:00,420
So here I actually want to get the artist for this in the database and I want to take them back to the

184
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,390
same page in some cases.

185
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,810
So I need to get the ID after the insert.

186
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:13,170
So back up here I'm going to create a new variable var new ID are very hostile, call host ID and it's

187
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,830
a type eight.

188
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,850
And now that I have all this information and I'm not doing any sanitizing of the data at all and you

189
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,500
should in a production web application, you should make sure that this is actually not empty, that

190
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,390
this is not empty.

191
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,150
We've got JavaScript validation which will take care of that in most cases.

192
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,240
But computer scientists are not optimist's.

193
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,850
We assume that things are going to go wrong.

194
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,090
We assume that an unlikely scenario is always going to take place.

195
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,030
But again, I'm not going to bother doing that in this course.

196
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,910
If you want to get a more detail on form, validation and so forth, I have a course in Web development.

197
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,150
You can go and you can go look for that one or find it online or do whatever you want.

198
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,710
But anyway, we're going to skip it right now.

199
00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:00,540
So I'll just get my values and I'll say new ID, which will be the returned value from my insert insert

200
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,810
statement, potentially an error or assign the value of.

201
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,100
And because I've added that method in the data, that database method we just wrote into the repo,

202
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:16,710
it's available to me repo db dot insert host and I pass it the model host which I called H.

203
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:25,110
If there's an error, if error is not equal to nil, then I'll just say logged print line error and

204
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:33,090
then I have a helper's method helper's dot server error which takes the response writer the request

205
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,200
and an error message.

206
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,290
And I'll return because I don't want to go any further after this point.

207
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:45,690
But if I, if I pass this then I can just say host ID is equal to new ideas and at that point we should

208
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,450
have it inserted.

209
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,520
Now what I'm going to do right now is get rid of this writing thing.

210
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,430
I'll just do a redirect back to the same host page that we were looking at.

211
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:04,350
So I'll say flat or set up, I'll put a message in the variable, which is repo dot app, dot session

212
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,820
dot put.

213
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:15,180
And it requires a context which I get from my ah my response right at my request ARGT context, I'll

214
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:21,960
name it Flash so it'll display a success message to the user and I'll just say changes saved.

215
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,510
And at this point I'll just do a redirect.

216
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,310
Now we're going to change this in a little while based upon the button that the people choose.

217
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,790
If they choose, save and continue or save and close, we'll do different things.

218
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,290
But right now I just want to get this working.

219
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,310
HTP don't redirect and it requires a response writer, a pointer to a request, the URL, which will

220
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,290
be admin host.

221
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,730
I mean, check that you URL it again, admin host and the host ID.

222
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,140
So I'm going to wrap this in a format as print F in a moment.

223
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:05,650
Format s, print F and will replace that percent d with the idea of our host, which is host ID, and

224
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:11,320
then the last parameter requires is a status C other, and that'll be good enough for our purposes.

225
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,460
So what did I get wrong here?

226
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,630
Oh yes.

227
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,080
To close this and I should do it.

228
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,340
So in theory we should be able to insert a host into the database at this point.

229
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,130
Let's see what we got wrong, if anything.

230
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,380
So I'll stop my application and start my application.

231
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,310
Unexpected parentheses.

232
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,950
And this is in go line 177.

233
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,790
I get too many parentheses there.

234
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,500
Let's try that again.

235
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,580
Run.

236
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,620
There it is, it's running, so let's start right from the beginning.

237
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:50,770
We'll go to our hosts page will say New Host and I'll call this localhost canonical name is localhost.

238
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,840
The URL will be SCDP Colden localhost AT&amp;T.

239
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,990
And I'm going to leave these other things that are not required empty, but I will make it active just

240
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,480
to make sure this is actually working.

241
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,720
So let's see if this works.

242
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,450
Save saving close page not found admin host zero, what do I get wrong?

243
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,380
So let's go back here and see what the URL is.

244
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,320
It's admin host zero.

245
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,310
Let's see what the log file has to say.

246
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,500
Oh, there's an error and the error is Syntex.

247
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,570
Oh, I got an error in my sequence.

248
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:35,840
So let's go find our our host talk show host, Underscore Postgres.

249
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,620
There it is right there.

250
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,320
So I have a typo somewhere.

251
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,460
Insert in the house.

252
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,620
OK, got to close this parentheses.

253
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,520
So let's stop that.

254
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,050
Try this again.

255
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,960
And see what else we got wrong, because I think there's another mistake, but we'll make sure.

256
00:17:52,370 --> 00:18:03,040
So localhost, localhost, HTP Cologne's localhost 88 and I'll make it active and see what else gets

257
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,340
wrong.

258
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,440
So let me put some blank lines in here.

259
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
Save close.

260
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,660
And it took me back to host one.

261
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,260
Perfect.

262
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:19,540
Now let's look in our database and let's look at our host table and look at the content and reload this.

263
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,580
And I have some values.

264
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,260
So I have the hostname.

265
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,460
I had the canonical name.

266
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,420
I have the euro.

267
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,530
I left those empty.

268
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,580
So they should be empty.

269
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,410
Active is zero.

270
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,580
And that I actually do that.

271
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:30,940
Right?

272
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm not sure.

273
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,160
OK, well, I'm not sure if I checked active or not, but so far it seems like it might be working.

274
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:43,660
So the next step is to actually grab the host from the database and display it in the list.

275
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,180
That requires a couple of steps to start with.

276
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,230
I need to be able to list all of the hosts that are in the database on this table.

277
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,050
So I need a database method that says get all hosts and gives me enough information to display it on

278
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,960
this page that I need to modify this page to actually use the information we're passing to this jet

279
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,540
template.

280
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:09,700
Then clicking on the host should take me to in this case it would be one, because that's the idea of

281
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,670
our inserted host.

282
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,300
OK, so we're getting closer.

283
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:18,790
We'll take care of the update section and the displaying of information in the next lecture or two.
