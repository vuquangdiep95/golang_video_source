1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,490
So let's just clean things up and make them a little more attractive, and the first thing I want to

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,100
do is take care of this, I don't want this date, which is my default date, because I don't like dealing

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,370
with moles in the database.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,830
I don't want that to show up unless there's actually been a check performed.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,140
And once a check is performed, which we're going to get to very shortly, this will have a valid date

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,920
and time stamp.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,550
Otherwise, I don't want to display anything.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,420
So let's go back over to our code and I'll show you.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,990
I have some helper functions in here, so I'm going to look, first of all, let's just go to the reads

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,270
file.

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,040
So in Route's, we'll find a place where we're displaying a page.

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,710
Here's a place where I'm displaying all healthy services and that calls this helper's render page and

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,200
render page right here is just a function.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,150
But it does have this one little thing down here at the end that says ad template functions.

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,960
Well, let's look at that.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,390
So ad template functions.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,080
It's just at the top of the same file, which is template or in a file called template.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,740
Dasch functions.

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:05,340
Dargo and I have three functions available to me human date, date from layout and date after year one.

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,690
Well, this means this is available to me in my in my all of my templates.

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,910
All of these three functions are.

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,030
So let's go back to the hosted chat and come down here where I'm displaying last check.

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,030
And let's just change this a little bit and see if I can get the syntax right in the first try.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,800
If and the function is called date after year one.

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,880
And it takes one argument, which is time, not time.

26
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,540
So back to host yet.

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:42,780
If a date after year one and my time dot time is last check if it's after year one, then it's actually

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,150
been populated with meaningful information in the database.

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,300
So I want to do something if that takes place else.

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,850
I want to display something else.

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:00,810
And so I if I just do this, if I cut that out of there and if the date is after your one, then it

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,380
should render it.

33
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,610
So if I go back to my.

34
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,570
And what tab is this?

35
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,710
This is in the healthy tab.

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,640
That's not helpful at all.

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,950
Let's go down to spending.

38
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,610
And say the same thing.

39
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,670
So do this, Hoopes.

40
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,580
If data after your data, after year one, date after

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:32,960
year one, I think that's what I called it, date after year one, yet if data after year one and pass

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,830
it last check.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,300
Then display the information.

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,640
And I'm going to do that.

45
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:50,930
I don't even need an alt statement, so now when I go load the host page right here and reload this

46
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,480
page and look at pending, that should be empty.

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,130
And it is OK.

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,290
But I don't actually want to display the date in that much information so I can actually take advantage

49
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:08,030
of this template function which says date after date from layout, and that takes a time and the layout

50
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,330
string and we just use the standard go layout string.

51
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:17,420
So back to host Jack and I can just say date from land because I want to call it a date from Las.

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,150
Data from layout, and it takes a time and then it takes the layout string, so we'll use the standard

53
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,420
twenty six zero one zero two and then 15 zero four.

54
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,110
And that will give me the correct date and time formatted in a way that makes sense to me in Canada.

55
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:44,110
If you like a different format, whatever format you want in your layout string, just using the standard

56
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,820
go date layout format and things will be good.

57
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,190
Now I could actually just either put an Alice in there as well just to make it a little more readable

58
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,830
if you wanted to, and say pending there.

59
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:09,780
So now if I come back here and reload this and I have a unclosed less parentheses and it's OK post three

60
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,390
19.

61
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,250
So I got a unclosed less right here.

62
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,170
Yes, let's try that again.

63
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,370
Now it should stay pending and it does.

64
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,250
OK, so this is the kind of information that will be changing using Web sockets in a little while.

65
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,940
But what I want to do next is to look at this bit right here.

66
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,430
I have, if you recall, in the database, if I go back to my database and look at the services, I

67
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,550
have this little icon and I'm not using that at all right now.

68
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,760
So let's see what we can put in there.

69
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,990
So I'm going to go to the font awesome site.

70
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,530
And this is where I'm I'm grabbing my free icons from.

71
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,750
And I have a paid version, but we're just going to use the free ones.

72
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,780
So let's go to icons and I'll just look for a server icon and there's one.

73
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,400
So these ones you have to pay for.

74
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,560
This one is free.

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
I'm going to use the free one.

76
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,110
How do I use this?

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,080
Start using this icon and the syntax is FASB dash f a dash server.

78
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:15,700
OK, so let's go back to our database and change this to f ASFA dash server and save that.

79
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,650
And go back here just to make things a little more visually appealing and where do I list the services?

80
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,540
So service is.

81
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,370
Right here.

82
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:35,070
So before that, before I displayed the service, I can actually mine the host jet file and I'm looking

83
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,270
at pending services.

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:48,980
Right here, just before the service name, let's put in a Spath class, equals service dog icon.

85
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,100
That might be it.

86
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,320
Let's find out.

87
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,930
That looks better, and then I have a little icon next to it, and that's purely for cosmetic purposes.

88
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,710
So every time I add a new service, I will add at least one more.

89
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,060
Before this, of course, is over, I'm going to give it a nice icon and you can use whatever icon set

90
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,480
you want.

91
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,260
But I think this is not a bad one.

92
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,440
So what I want to do next is to actually perform a check.

93
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,120
I want when I click on this and I'm going to add some success to give it a little pointer icon just

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,870
because I can.

95
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,110
I actually do want it to fire a request off and I want to get the response back and I'll use Ajax to

96
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,510
fire the request off and to handle the response.

97
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,740
So at least for right now, we'll change that as time goes on.

98
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,070
But I would just want to get this working.

99
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:40,300
So this means we need to write some code that will actually perform a check and we'll start that process

100
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,800
in the next lecture.
