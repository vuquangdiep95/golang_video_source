1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,030
OK, so now we want to have some services showing up, and first of all, I want to fix this because

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:06,710
it bothers me.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,180
I want that to be a nice little badge.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:15,270
So let's go back to the idea and let's look at the hosts play host hosts Jet right here.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,390
And I want this to be a badge.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,010
And the way I had it before was like this badge badge success.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,210
And I didn't work and it didn't work because this is the way it used to be in bootstrap for but in bootstrap

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,630
five.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,340
Now it is big for some reason.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,760
I'm not entirely sure why, but I'm sure they have a good reason.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,330
So let's make this a badge and big danger.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,020
And when I say that and come back here to my web browser, that should look like a nice little badge.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,510
It does.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,700
And I want the same thing over here.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:52,050
I want a green badge that says one healthy service and a red badge that says one problem service or

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,800
something like that.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,180
I want those to be here.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,360
And of course, to make that happen, we need to actually add some services under this tent.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,220
So right now, that just has some tech.

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,310
So let's go fix that up and get it set up so we can populated with useful information.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,170
So I'll go back to my host page and find the service content right here and I'll delete that text and

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:22,170
put in a div class equals row and then a div class equals call and then I'll put a heading in each three

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,250
services.

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:37,220
Underneath that I'll put a table table class equals table table striped and a T head and a tr and T

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,830
which I'll just call service and we'll just have one, one column in this and then we'll have a Tibaldi

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,200
and a TR.

27
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,170
I'll just make that empty for right now.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,890
TD td.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,260
OK, so let's see what that looks like.

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,350
Reload this page, click on services.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,710
OK, maybe push that down a little bit so class equals maybe three.

32
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,770
Let's save that and that should push it down a little bit and it does.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,970
OK, so this will list our services and we'll have one or two services now if we look at our database.

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:22,130
Right here, under services, under content, we don't have any anything we're monitoring right now

35
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:22,580
at all.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,350
So what I want a monitor to start with is just a website to make sure a Web server is actually running

37
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,640
a service in here.

38
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,180
And I'll call it HTTP, which will be a sugarbeet.

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,800
We'll make it active.

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm going to leave the icon empty and I'll have to create it at some date, say twenty twenty one 02.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,550
Twenty to twenty twenty one zero two twenty two and save that.

42
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,310
So now I have one entry in my services table which says icon cannot be not so icon will be.

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,020
Oh call it.

44
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,140
If a server doesn't matter what it is we'll fix that later.

45
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,780
We're going to use a font awesome icon at some point possibly.

46
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,230
So I have that in there now.

47
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,670
I have one entry in my services table and if I reload, that's a good idea too.

48
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,920
Clearly I had one in here at some point, but that doesn't matter.

49
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,660
I just want to have a service in here.

50
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:25,910
OK, so I'll reload this and what I'm going to do is just list all of the services that we have here

51
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,270
with a radio button beside it that's either on or off.

52
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,760
And I'll use that same kind of switch like I have up here.

53
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,890
OK, so let's go in here.

54
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,890
And I'm just going to hard code this right now just to get it working.

55
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,490
We'll call this service and then I'll duplicate that row or that TD and call it status.

56
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,340
And here I'll have HTP.

57
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,150
And underneath that I'll pull a switch.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,110
Now, the syntax for the switch, I have that up here somewhere.

59
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,010
Right here.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,330
Copy this and paste it down here and just pull the logic out of it, so we'll take this statement out.

61
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:16,520
Here and with the Idy will be HTP service and the name will be HTP.

62
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,020
OK, so let's just save that, reload this and see what it looks like.

63
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,740
OK, not quite right.

64
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,690
What did I get wrong?

65
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,790
Oh, yeah, I've got to put this around it, div class equals form, check, form, switch.

66
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:44,530
So that should be here, pasted in here, give it a closing, give format everything and reload the

67
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:44,930
page.

68
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,190
OK, so managed services.

69
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,580
So we're just going to have one right now on or off.

70
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,530
And this isn't reading anything from the database.

71
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,790
It's not saving it at all because we've not written those things yet.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,280
So let's go look at our database structure as it exists and go under models don't go right now.

73
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:10,120
We have a host and a host has only the things that correspond to the kinds of things that are actually

74
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,980
in the database.

75
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,490
But we actually want more information associated with a given host.

76
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,400
So I'm going to say services and that's going to be a slice of of services.

77
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,850
Since I'm in the model package, I don't have to pretend that with models.

78
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,720
So those services, should it be a slice of services?

79
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,090
It should be a slice of hosted services.

80
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:42,110
Like that, and I'll call this host services just to be absolutely consistent so I don't get confused

81
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,820
about what's what.

82
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:50,150
So how service consists of a slice of hosted services so one host can have one or more services or no

83
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,760
services if we want to do it that way.

84
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,130
And down here under host services, I'm going to add another thing here as well.

85
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,450
I'm going to actually put the service information so the service is a service.

86
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,930
One service will be associated with one service, which is called services, for reasons I'm not entirely

87
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,440
sure about.

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,270
But there you go.

89
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,790
So that gives us our necessary database structure.

90
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:21,170
Engo And now of course, that means when we get a host by ID, we need to also get its host services

91
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,280
and that host service.

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Every service we get for a host, every host service we get for a host should also have a service associated

93
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,590
with it.

94
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:34,700
So right now we're monitoring just whether or not a Web server is we're going to do one service and

95
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,950
maybe we'll add another one down the road, maybe we won't.

96
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,870
But right now we're going to work with one just to get it going.

97
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,890
So this gives us our necessary markup.

98
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,710
We have a place to display the HDP and whether it's on or off.

99
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,360
So now we need to have the means of adding a service to a host by checking it and making it active or

100
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,420
checking it and making it inactive.

101
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,370
So when we add a host, it adds a host with no services.

102
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,980
So the very first time we display this page, if we add a new house, if we for first time we display

103
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,620
this tab, this will be unchecked and there will be no entry in the database associated with the host

104
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,310
service HTTP.

105
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,300
But when we turn it on and click save and we'll need a save button here at some point or else do it

106
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,620
using Ajax, then it will put the necessary entry into the database.

107
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,820
If it already exists, it'll, it'll turn it inactive if we turn it off.

108
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,340
But if it doesn't exist it'll enter it and make it active.

109
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,000
OK, so we'll take care of that in the next lecture or two.
