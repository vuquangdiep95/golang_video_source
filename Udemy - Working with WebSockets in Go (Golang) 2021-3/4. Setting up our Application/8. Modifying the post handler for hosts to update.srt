1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,340
So right now, we can display a host on this page, so I'm looking at the one host in the database,

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:13,210
which is Itaewon, so I'm an admin host one, and it is showing the information is in the database.

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,290
And this is all accurate because this host is currently not active and I'm not sure that works.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:17,550
Right.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:24,130
So let's write the necessary code in our handler to update the hosts in the database and make sure this

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,710
active is doing what it's supposed to do.

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,690
So I'm back in my handlers, I'm in Handler Go and I'm in the Method Post host.

8
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,730
And right now we have some logic that says if the idea is greater than zero when somebody posts this,

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,460
get the host from the database, otherwise update all the values and inserted into the database.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,870
So this is accurate and it works well.

11
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,980
We can simplify things.

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,290
We can take the information actually right now.

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,030
Let's get the host.

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:01:02,020
So we'll say host and potentially an error are assigned the value of repo DB, get hosted by ID and

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,360
we pass in the host ID, which is ID.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,050
We get that from the URL up here and that gets me the host.

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:14,830
If there's an error, if error is not equal to nil, then I'm just going to log the error print line

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,870
error and I'll return.

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,910
I'll just display a blank screen.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,130
And of course you don't want to do that in production, but for our purposes right now, this is sufficient.

21
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,240
Otherwise our value of of H which we declared up here on line 157, that's a sign the value of host.

22
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,720
So we now have the host from the database.

23
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,440
Do we really need this statement?

24
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,650
I don't think we do.

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,760
So let's get rid of that.

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,720
And come down here and get rid of that, I do, in fact, let me just reformat this.

27
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,440
No matter what happens, I want the value, the values that the user entered to be assigned to host

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,860
here.

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,930
I'm overriding the existing values.

30
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,730
And if the ID is not zero, I'm just entering the values into an empty house model.

31
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,640
So that works great.

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,030
Here's the part where we want our if statement.

33
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:13,410
If Ivy is greater than zero, then we'll update the host, otherwise we'll insert the host.

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,190
So this is the part we want to change right here.

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,010
All I want to do is call my update.

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:28,400
Error is assign the value of repo DB update host, which is right there, and I pass in my house model.

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,100
And again, if there's an error, I'll just log it and return.

38
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:41,240
So in theory, that should work, so let's try this and I'm going to always return back to where we're

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,040
going before I have an error in here somewhere.

40
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,000
Let me find this.

41
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,440
Right there.

42
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:55,300
Should be like that, and this new idea should be inside that statement right here.

43
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:06,780
Because I'm redirecting to host I.D., which is actually now that's going to be hosting the equals I.D..

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,760
And make sure I've got this returning properly.

45
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:25,200
Host was new I.D., which just changed that the host ID eight ID and make this redirect to a fourth

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,780
ID, OK, that should work properly now.

47
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:37,120
All I was doing was making sure that when I did the redirect I'm going back to A'Court ID after I do

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,580
by insert here, I just assign the value H or the Model H, which is our host.

49
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,780
I give it the returned ID for the insert statement.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,200
So in theory this should work.

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,130
So let's start our application hostilely declared but not used.

52
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,570
Let's get rid of that.

53
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,080
All right, now it should work.

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,390
So I run I go back to my Web browser, I reload to make sure I'm looking at the right page, and let's

55
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,450
just give it an IP address of one two seven zero zero.

56
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,790
That one, the localhost IP address, save and close, which gives me an error.

57
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,810
And the error is syntax error at or near active.

58
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,120
OK, let's find our error in the update.

59
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,670
So that's in host up postgrads get hosted ID update.

60
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,870
So the act, the error is here.

61
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,010
I'm missing a comma.

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,240
I do that all the time.

63
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,290
So let's start our up.

64
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,310
Stop our application.

65
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,390
Start our application.

66
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,520
And reload this page by clicking the oil and pressing air, giving it an IP address and one two seven

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,590
zero zero one and save and it brings me back and I saved it.

68
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,300
Now, let's try this active button.

69
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,800
Safe.

70
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,160
And it's not displaying it properly, let's look in the database and see what's happened there.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,060
So I'll go to the content and refresh this and active is still zero.

72
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,460
So there's a problem there somewhere.

73
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,190
OK.

74
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,210
Yeah, it's still zero, so let's figure out what we're doing wrong on that one.

75
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,780
It's got to be in the host's Jett page and it has to be in the part where I have the active right here.

76
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,260
So I have an input classes, form check input.

77
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,920
That's correct.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,560
Value is hosted active.

79
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,160
OK, type is a check, but it is active.

80
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,790
Name is active.

81
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,790
Well, first of all, let's put it in this statement in there to check it if necessary.

82
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,570
If.

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:43,210
Are active, equals one, if it is active, then checked and.

84
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,870
OK, let's see if that actually renders properly reloaded good.

85
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:57,110
Now let's go into the database and manually change it to be active, so I'll change that to one and

86
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,190
save the changes.

87
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,030
Good.

88
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,690
And I want to load this page that should be checked.

89
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,750
It is OK.

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,320
So it is checking it when it's active, but what it's not doing is passing the necessary information.

91
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,900
So can I actually make this inactive and save?

92
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,800
OK, and now make it active and safe.

93
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,300
Now it's still not passing that information.

94
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,940
So this is a check and does it have a name I.D.?

95
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,320
Active name is active.

96
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,410
OK, and the value is most active.

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,940
Let's just change that to one.

98
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,940
So it doesn't really matter what it is, the way the checkboxes work, if it's checked, it sends the

99
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,680
value as part of the form post.

100
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,180
If it's not checked, it doesn't even include it.

101
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,010
So let's just save that and go back here and we're going to restart the application.

102
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,370
Now, we don't let's reload the page, make it active and save it.

103
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,480
Save and close.

104
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,490
OK, now let's make it inactive.

105
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,060
Save, save and close.

106
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,760
Perfect.

107
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,960
What's in the database?

108
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,820
Reload.

109
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,000
It's inactive.

110
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,460
Now let's make it active.

111
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,920
Save and reload, and now it's active, so that's all it was, we just need to make sure that we handle

112
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,170
checkboxes the way that checkboxes are actually handled, send disvalue when it's checked, otherwise

113
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,910
it doesn't even get included in the post.

114
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,620
So that should work just fine.

115
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,950
OK, so the next step now that we've got this part going and we still have to deal with these, Tab's

116
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,590
up here, but we'll get to those in a while.

117
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,320
The next step is when I click on the hosts page.

118
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,200
I actually want my one hosta that's in the database to be loaded here on this screen.

119
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,550
So in the next lecture will take care of that.

120
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,390
We'll have to read a database handler and pass the information to this template.

121
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,190
And that's pretty straightforward.
