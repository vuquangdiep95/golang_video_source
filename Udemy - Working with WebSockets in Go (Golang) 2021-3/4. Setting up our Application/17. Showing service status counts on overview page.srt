1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,330
So we have our host displaying properly in the overview page, and the next thing I want to do is populate

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,280
the number zero in all four of these boxes with the actual accurate number.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,680
How many healthy services are we monitoring?

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,710
How many pending services are we monitoring?

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,940
So on and so forth.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,120
And that's pretty simple.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,750
We just need to get a query written that will return the count of all of those services and pass that

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,330
data to our handler and then render this page with the appropriate information.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:35,990
And if you recall, if we go back to our code here and I go two routes and I look at the admin dashboard,

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,150
I'm hard coding zero in right now.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:44,840
So we just we need to get a database query that executes right before this populates the four zeros

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,580
with actual meaningful information and pass that off to our template and everything else should just

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:49,900
work.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,820
So let's go figure out how we're going to do this.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,240
I could if I wanted to let me go to my postgrads client and I'm looking at the host services table.

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:07,040
All we really want here for pending, for example, is account of all of the entries in this table that

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,700
have the status of pending and that have active set to one.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,370
So let's just write some sequel.

19
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,280
I'll do it right here.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:24,620
So I'll say select count IDE from host services where active equals one and status equals pending.

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,130
I run that I should get a one and I do.

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,870
But if I change that to say healthy, I should get zero and I do.

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,730
OK, so I'm going to put this back depending and I'm going to delete this now.

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:45,380
I could if I wanted to write one database query that does this and change the value of the pending part

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,070
using a parameter and just make for database queries.

26
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,510
Or I can make one database query, which I think is way more efficient.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,590
So I'm going to do that instead.

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:02,420
So I'll put before that statement I just wrote Select and then I'll surround this statement in parentheses

29
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,000
and put as pending here.

30
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,300
Let's just run that and make sure that it works and it does.

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,930
Now I'll delete that semicolon, copy this entire line and has a comma at the end of it now.

32
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,710
And that's important.

33
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,600
Paste it three more times.

34
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,210
Delete the last comma and change pending for the second one to say healthy and then put healthy in here.

35
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,340
And then warning and warning.

36
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,400
And energy and then problem, so those will be our four statuses problem.

37
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,900
Now when I run this, I get all the information in one query and that seems way more efficient to me.

38
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,280
So let me copy this whole query and go back to my code and go to host postgrads and I'll just put a

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,040
new function in here.

40
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,110
It doesn't matter where it goes.

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:07,260
Func M and it's got a receiver of postgrads DB and I'll say get all service status counts, which is

42
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:14,700
as good a name as any, and it doesn't take any parameters and it returns and eat and eat and eat and

43
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,560
eat and potentially an error.

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:25,350
OK, and then I'll put my query in here and I'll just paste in the sequel I wrote a moment ago, OK,

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,040
and I'll just have this over so it looks a little more attractive.

46
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,250
Put this back tick up here now I my context so I'll just copy it from the function right next to it

47
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,500
and I would just execute the query, but I got to declare four variables to store things in.

48
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:48,410
So I'll say var pending warning know pending healthy to them in the same order.

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,480
Healthy warning and problem.

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,700
Those are all going to be ense and now I'll just execute my query.

51
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:07,500
So Roe is a sign, the value of IMDB, the query, query, row context and pass it in my context hasset

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,190
my query.

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:18,150
I have no parameters so I should be able to now just say error is sign the value of Rodust scanned and

54
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,260
scanned into those four variables and the first thing I'm getting is pending.

55
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,490
So I'll scan that into my pending variable and I'll just duplicate that three more times.

56
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,170
That's one too many.

57
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,440
And the second one is healthy.

58
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,180
The third one is warning, the fourth one is problem.

59
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,340
Check for an error.

60
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,090
If error is not equal to nil, I'll return zero zero zero zero.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,180
So I'm going to ignore those.

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,210
They'll be paying attention to the error instead and the error otherwise.

63
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,660
Return pending healthy.

64
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,250
Warning problem and no, OK, so that should do it.

65
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:10,980
So let me copy this signature, open my repository and paste that new method right in here and now it's

66
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,210
available to me so I can go back to my roots, find the admin dashboard.

67
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:23,310
And now rather than passing these, I will say instead, let's see what order do we do them in pending,

68
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:33,270
then healthy, then warning, then problem and error are assigned the value of repo DB and I think I

69
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,810
called that get all service status counts there.

70
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,640
If error is not equal to nil and I'll just do what I've been doing right along.

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,460
Logged uprate line error and return so they'll see a blank screen, but we can check the log file to

72
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,300
see what's going on.

73
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:54,300
And in production I would do something a little more user friendly, but I'm not in production now.

74
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:03,420
I substitute the number healthy with healthy, the no problem with problem, the number pending with

75
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,900
pending and then no warning with warning.

76
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,630
And if I stop my application and clear this and run my application.

77
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,170
And go back to my dashboard and say, I'll just go to the House page, then I'll go back to overview.

78
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,370
I have one pending service.

79
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,100
Perfect.

80
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,030
And if I go back to my database, I need to go to my database.

81
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:35,560
I can just go to my hosts and look at my services and turn this one off, which should take place in

82
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,960
the background that I get an error message.

83
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,430
I'm terminated, quoted string Learjet.

84
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,860
I'm going to fix that.

85
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,570
Where is the layout Parshall's Jast Jet and under UN terminated quoted string.

86
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,940
So let's find that I must have hit return at some point and I better fix that right now.

87
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,260
So that's interviews.

88
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,610
Parshall's Jast jet, and it says to look at line for, line for.

89
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,240
And I get that somehow I mess this up, so let's fix that.

90
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,660
Let's see what's going on here.

91
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,640
Oh, I know what it is, I must have formatted this text at some point, and that messed it all up.

92
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,990
So this can go back up here.

93
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,660
This can come back up here.

94
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:41,170
That's one of the problems of not having a correct plug in for jet for my I.D. And it's making me rethink

95
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,340
using this in the future.

96
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,210
But let's just make sure that's not going to generate any more errors and reload this.

97
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,040
Check the console, no errors.

98
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,880
Now, if I go to manage services and make that inactive, that's better.

99
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,060
OK, that's where I wanted to get.

100
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,520
So I.

101
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,020
You don't have that error, I'm sure.

102
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,680
But I do.

103
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:08,290
And just so you know, if I am looking at this just jet page and I reformat it by hitting the key combination

104
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:14,260
that reformats my text sometimes, but not always, which is the most irritating kind of error ever.

105
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,970
It will actually break the formatting for this this sort of thing.

106
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,930
And that's what happened here.

107
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,540
But spaces between the hyphens and put things in other lines.

108
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,550
Anyway, I cleaned it up.

109
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,320
So now that's working.

110
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:31,240
Now, if I go back to my overview, this should say zero, and it does because that service is not active

111
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,230
on localhost.

112
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:37,930
But when I go back to localhost, go to services, turn it back on and go back to my overview.

113
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,960
Now, it shows the number one in pending over here, and that's exactly what I wanted to do.

114
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,360
So this page, it looks like it's done.

115
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,560
It's working exactly the way I want it to.

116
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:54,130
So the next step and we'll do this for one and I'll leave the other three is an exercise for you because

117
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,900
it's exactly the same sort of thing.

118
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,050
We need this page to list all of the problems, all of the pending services, and we want to see the

119
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,900
hostname, the service name, the status and the message.

120
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,930
And there will be no message because it's pending.

121
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,730
Nothing's happened yet.

122
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,900
The status will just be pending.

123
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,630
The service will be the name of the service in our case, HTTP and the name of the host is the name

124
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,230
of the host.

125
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,760
And this is just a quick way to list all of the services that are in a given status.

126
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,680
And we want to be able to click on the service or the host and go right to the appropriate page.

127
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,470
OK, so we'll take care of that in the next lecture and then I'll leave the last three that are not

128
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,210
the pending status as an exercise for you, which should be really straightforward.
