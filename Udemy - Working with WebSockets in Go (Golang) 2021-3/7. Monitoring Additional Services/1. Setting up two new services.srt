1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,440
So this time around, we want to add additional services to monitor, and I think the easiest one to

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,430
start with is actually monitoring HTP s.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,410
So in our handler's package, we already have underperformed checks.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,110
We have at the very top constants.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,800
HTTP is equal to one htp s equals to two.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,370
That's the one I want to monitor.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:33,000
So if we think about this logically in these scheduled check part, we look at the test services for

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,620
host.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,500
That's the one that we actually want to look at.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,260
So let's go down to that method.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,160
And here we only have one case we want to add a second case to look for HDB secure Web server connections.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,120
So to make that happen, there's a few steps we probably should take care of to begin with.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,530
So right now, just make sure your application is not running.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,890
So stop it and let's go over to our database client, whatever database client you're using to connect

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,170
and look at the services table right now.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,550
There's only one entry in there.

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,340
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete first of all, I'm going to go to hosts and I'm going

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,230
to delete this house just by deleting that record and saying save changes.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,340
So currently we're monitoring no hosts.

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,780
And because we have four Q relationships, we're not monitoring any host services.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,580
And I'm going to go back to services and I'm going to add a new service here.

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,310
I'm actually going to add two women will do them now and get them out of the way.

23
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:36,450
And I'm going to add HTP s and I'll make it active and I'll make its font faez f a dash server, same

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,570
as we had before, and I'll put a default date in there.

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:49,290
Twenty twenty one zero three oh ten twenty twenty one zero three dash ten and I'll hit return and then

26
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,130
I'll add another one SSL and I'll make that active as well and I'll make that effort.

27
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,460
Ashlock just to give it a lock icon and I'll put the same date in there.

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,860
Twenty twenty one zero three ten twenty twenty one zero three ten.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,380
And I'll hit return and I'll save the changes.

30
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,660
Now this next step is important.

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:18,480
If like me you have numbers that are not two and three here, go change https to two and SSL to three

32
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,350
because those keys must exactly match what we have back in our idy at the very top.

33
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,050
This, this and this.

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,090
This one is two and this one is three.

35
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,360
So those need to match and in my case they do.

36
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:39,180
Now I'm also going to go back to my database and just to clean things up a little bit, I'll completely

37
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,980
truncate this this event's table because I have some stuff in there that doesn't really match any host

38
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,300
right now, so I'll just truncate it.

39
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,220
So delete all those records.

40
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,130
OK, now let's start writing some code and what we need to do here to begin with is to go back to our

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,580
idea and I'll find that method again, because I'll be going back there shortly, OK?

42
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,070
I need to open my database.

43
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,770
What we're going to do is we're going to read a host here.

44
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:13,070
So let me go to my repository and go to DB Repo and find host Postgres Culgoa.

45
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,620
Our hosts underscore postgrads Keywell don't go.

46
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,570
And I want to find the very first method where I insert a host and it's called insert host.

47
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,190
In my case, it's right at the top of the file.

48
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:29,450
But find the insert host method and scroll down to the part where we say add hosts services and set

49
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,170
to inactive.

50
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,570
And I want to modify that because when I add a host, I don't want to just copy and paste this to more

51
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,750
times and insert one for it to add one for Eighty-three.

52
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,970
Actually want to just look at the services table, find all of the services and add a service to a host

53
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,000
and set it to an active same as we were before.

54
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,410
So this is really not that difficult.

55
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm going to write a new query and I'll just use a variable I've already have used above called query

56
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,410
and it's a simple query, select ID from services.

57
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,750
OK, so that's my new query.

58
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,390
I'm going to go get all of the IDs for all of the services in the service table and I'll create a new

59
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:19,340
variable which I'll call service rows and potentially an error that's assigned the value of IMDB query

60
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:26,720
context and had it the context and send out a query check for an error.

61
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:34,880
If error is not equal to nil, then I'll just say log print line error and I'll return zero.

62
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:43,130
And the air, OK, and now, of course, I need to defer my service, Rose.

63
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:53,350
Up close, so we don't get a memory leak and I would just loop through all of the service post for service

64
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,850
Rose Dot next.

65
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:09,170
I'll create a variable VA service ID of type Int and I will scan into that newly created variable service

66
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:09,680
rose.

67
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,360
Scan into a reference to service ID.

68
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,140
So now I have the ID and I should check for an error.

69
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,360
I'll just copy and paste this.

70
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:34,050
Now that I have that, I can actually go down here and grab this all of this, cut it out of there,

71
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,080
paste it into here and modify it as necessary.

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,070
So here I am inserting host service or host ID and service ID and I have a hard coded one.

73
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,590
So I'll just change that to dollar sign too, which means I have to update this to Dollar Sign three

74
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,430
and this dollar sign for and my second argument after new I.D. will actually be service I.D..

75
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:07,500
So now when I execute this, it will actually automatically add all of the services for that particular

76
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:07,980
host.

77
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,850
So we'll have three and they'll all be set to inactive, which is exactly what I want.

78
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,220
The other thing I want to do is I'm going to finally get hosted by ID and in my case, it's the very

79
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,910
next method.

80
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,490
And I'm just going to add something here that's purely cosmetic.

81
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,490
So when I get it services, I'm simply going to add a little bit here that will give me the services

82
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,660
in a good order.

83
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,330
I'll say order by.

84
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,490
Escort service name that will list the services in alphabetical order.

85
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,900
OK, so that is a good start.

86
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:46,360
Let's start our application, make sure everything works as it should, and I will go back to my Web

87
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,900
browser.

88
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:59,070
Create a new window and I'll go to localhost 4000 and I'll have to log in admin at example dot com and

89
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,570
my password is password.

90
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,810
And we should have no hosts, but once we get in here and we don't no services, no hosts, so let's

91
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,970
go to the hosts tab at a new host and I'll have the same when I was using before.

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,480
So local host, local host.

93
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,080
The URL is htp colon slash slash localhost colon 80 80.

94
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,720
My IP address I'm not using but I'll put it in anyway.

95
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:33,310
And again, I'm in New Brunswick, Canada, and my operating system that I'm monitoring is Mac OS X

96
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,540
and I'll make it active.

97
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,290
So when I save this someday we should fix this button.

98
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,280
But that's not critical.

99
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,930
So I'm going ignore right now because these both do the same thing, save and continue.

100
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,870
Now I should have some services listed here that are all inactive and I have all three of them now.

101
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,570
This one works and I can turn it on and we'll actually work.

102
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,980
But this one doesn't currently do anything and we do have some things we want to add there.

103
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:04,660
So let's look at one other change we're going to have to make right now when I have three services.

104
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,210
If I say active, that's saved it and I go over to the pending table.

105
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,990
You'll see that it lists all of the ones, even if they're not active and that's not right, so we could

106
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,690
modify the query that only will pull out the active services, but then we'd have to modify the query

107
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,770
again to list all of the services here.

108
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:34,460
So all I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to my idee and I will find the host page, which is post

109
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:41,910
jet or hosted chat, and I'll just modify the way that I'm displaying the information in all of those

110
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,450
tabs.

111
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,700
So I'll scroll up to.

112
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:53,530
Healthy is the first one I'm just going to modify this if status equals healthy and.

113
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,340
Active equals one, and I'll just copy that, so that way we'll loop through all the services for the

114
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,580
only show me the ones that are active on those appropriate tabs and the same thing here.

115
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,010
Paiste and the same thing for problem.

116
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,780
Paced and finally for pending.

117
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:26,120
Paiste, So if I have no typographical errors, I should be able to come back here, reload this page,

118
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,200
look at the pending tab and only see my one active service.

119
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,690
OK, so back under managed services, all three are there.

120
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,960
All right, so that gets us going.

121
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:44,990
We now have a means of getting all the necessary services associated with any host that we add in.

122
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,350
The next lecture will actually start monitoring HTTPS services in our case because we're running a local

123
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,110
the local host that doesn't have an SSL certificate.

124
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,940
It will always return an error.

125
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:56,930
But that's OK.

126
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,080
We just want to make sure we can monitor more than one service.
