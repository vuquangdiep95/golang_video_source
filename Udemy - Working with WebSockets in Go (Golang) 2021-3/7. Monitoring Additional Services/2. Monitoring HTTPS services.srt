1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,770
So now we want to set up the actual monitoring for HTP services, but before we do that, I did have

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,070
a typo in the last lecture and this is in the host jet file when I was copy and pasting this little

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,130
bit right here and active equals one, I accidentally put that inside the quotation marks.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,440
So this belongs over here.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,160
So fix that and you may have noticed that and fixed it anyway.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,870
But we all make typographical errors.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,070
So let's go over to our perform checks dot go file.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,810
And the part we're looking at, of course, is this test service for hosts.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,400
And we have this switch statement which checks for the case of HTP and obviously we want another case.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,440
So I can just copy this and paste it right here and make this https, which is a constant.

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,890
And as you know, that concept is set to do so.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,340
This is calling a method, a test htp for host.

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,710
And obviously we want to put an S in there and then actually go and create this method.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,340
So I'll go down to test HTP for host and this is really easy and simply copy this method because it's

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,300
virtually the same.

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,510
I could modify this method to handle both cases, but I'll just keep it simple.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,290
Rename it to test http s for host and there's very little else to change here.

18
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:31,230
Basically I need to change this part where I'm looking for HTP s and changing it to HTP and move the

19
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,900
S, so that was easy.

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,160
And then down here.

21
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,060
Is there anything else to change.

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,920
No.

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,190
That should literally do it.

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:47,790
So I think at this point all we have to do is stop our application, start our application.

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:58,280
And go back to our Web browser and try going to the overview page, see what it looks like right now.

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,840
We have one healthy service and we're only monitoring one service.

27
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:08,260
So let's go to localhost and go to managed services and turn on HTP s.

28
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,870
And that should, with no change, no other changes in the code, appear under the pending tab.

29
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,980
And it does.

30
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,840
And I'll actually just check click check now because I don't want to wait the default three minutes

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,200
for that service and we should get an error and there it is.

32
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,920
So if we go to error problems.

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,870
Everything works as expected.

34
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,680
OK, that was the easy one, the next one, and we'll do this in the next lecture or two, is to monitor

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,910
SSL certificates.

36
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,360
And what I want to check there is a very simple thing.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,660
How many days are left until our SSL certificate expires?

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,790
And if it's less than some predefined number, give a warning if it's less than some smaller number

39
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,410
than give a problem and we'll we'll take care of that in the next lecture or two.
