1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:06,370
So it's time to start working with the database and what we're going to do is install a database and

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,970
the one I'm recommending and the one I'll be using throughout the remainder of this course is Postgres.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,440
There are other ones, of course, but postgrads is the one I'm going to work with.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,470
And what we're going to do is install this, install a graphical client that allows us to connect to

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:27,010
it and we'll figure out how databases work before we actually get to the steps where we hook our application

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,140
up to postgrads and start persisting our data in that way.

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:41,980
So the install for postgrads is found at this early PostgreSQL Duggie download, and we're going to

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,390
do it slightly differently depending on whether you're on Windows or Mac.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,840
We'll start with windows.

10
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,510
If you're on windows, click on the Windows button and what you're going to do is click download the

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,820
installer right here and that will take you to a page that shows all the various downloads.

12
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:05,830
And assuming you're on a Windows 64 bit system, which most of you probably are because 32 bit systems

13
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:10,840
are getting really old, download this version at the time I record this, it's thirteen point one.

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,110
Download that and run the installer.

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,340
Now, when you run the installer, when you get to the second or third step of the installer, it's

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:25,090
going to ask you, first of all, ask you to set postgrads, say yes, then step to choose a directory.

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,880
Just choose the default directory.

18
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,400
Step three is going to say select components.

19
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,050
And I strongly recommend you leave postgrads server installed.

20
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,980
You have to have that.

21
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,090
That'll be the first option.

22
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,530
The second option is called PJI admin for uncheck that.

23
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,080
And I want to suggest you uncheck that for a simple reason.

24
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,770
That is a client that isn't installed as part of the process that actually allows you to connect to

25
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,330
your database through a Web browser and manage the content that way.

26
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,400
So it's a graphical user interface that installs a server on your machine and allows you to connect

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,160
to your local installation of the database through Web browser.

28
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:09,790
The problem with that is every time I have tried to use that, it has grabbed all the system resources

29
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,960
from my computer.

30
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,580
Are there my Windows machine or my Mac machine to the point where things become unresponsive.

31
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:22,930
So I strongly recommend you don't install PJI admin for but leave everything else check to the postgrads

32
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,610
server, the command line tools and leave two of them unchecked.

33
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,370
PJI had been for and don't bother with Stack Builder.

34
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,500
That's of no value to us for this course.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,070
So you're only going to have two things checked when you install on Windows Postgrads Server and command

36
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,780
line tools and then install it.

37
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,240
Now if you're on a Mac, it's a little easier.

38
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,710
So we're going to go back here to packages.

39
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,620
This is where we started off on the download page.

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,860
Choose Mac OS and scroll down.

41
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,880
Scroll down to this part PostgreSQL app, download this application and it's really, really easy.

42
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,590
It's just an application that you when you run it, you use double click on it to start it.

43
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,780
Your server is running and when you quit out of it, your server shuts down and you can't get any simpler

44
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,260
than that.

45
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,730
So that's how you install the database server on your local machine.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,310
Then in order to connect to that server using a graphical user interface, we're going to go to this

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,280
place de Beever DB ver community.

48
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:31,840
So it's called DB Beavertail Slash Download and download the community edition.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,930
So for Windows there's a 64 64 bit installer and for Mac here's the installer or the DMG.

50
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,200
Use whichever version you want, but install that and once you do, you'll be all set, will be able

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,040
to connect to our local machine and will be able to start doing things.

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,410
So get those things installed and when you're done, come back and we'll move on to the next lecture

53
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,900
and start playing with the actual database.
