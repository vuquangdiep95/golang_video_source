00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,980
So if you don't have go installed, you're going to have to do that before you can go any further.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,770
Unfortunately, it's really, really easy.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,380
Just go to this URL, go langue and click on this big button that says download go.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,980
And once you get here, if you're on Windows, you're going to download this installer.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,280
If you're on a Mac, you're going to download this installer.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,370
And if you're on Linux, you'll download this and follow the instructions for installing it.

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,630
That way, if you want to, you can install it from source.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,790
I don't recommend that you do because it's a lot more work and gives you no actual functional benefits,

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,550
at least for the purposes of this course.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,680
So go download, go and install it.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,590
And once you're done that, let's move on to the next item.
