00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,530
So if you've been working and go for a while, you probably already have an I.D., but just in case,

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,410
if you don't have one, here is a free, good option for you.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:16,690
So just go to this URL, Coorg Visual Studio, dot com download with a capital D. and download the version

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,430
for your particular operating system.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,450
I am on a Mac, so I've already downloaded it and I've already installed it, but I haven't actually

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,140
started it yet.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,410
Actually, I uninstalled it just so I could record this lecture.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,420
So hopefully this will work the way I expect it to.

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,550
Once you have it installed, start it up.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,810
And there's a couple of things we need to do to make sure that everything is going to work the way that

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,440
we want it to.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,150
So this is up and running now, but I need to install some extensions for go, so what I'm going to

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:52,460
do, first of all, is open the the extension's marketplace, which is command shift X UniMac or a command

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,430
shift X on a macia and command shift or control shift X on windows.

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,290
And once I've got that, I will search for go.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,900
And here it is, very first one go as I record this is version zero point two two.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,120
Oh I'm going to install it and it's now installed.

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:18,380
So now I will go to open the command pallet commandership on a Mac and control ship on Windows.

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,670
And from here I'm going to look for Go Kolan Install update tools right here.

20
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,540
And once it shows up, it'll show up again here in a second.

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,510
I need to make sure everything here is checked.

22
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,630
So I'll just click this to check everything and say, OK.

23
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,300
And it's installing them, as you can see, at the bottom of the screen.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,360
And once that's done, just restart the idee and you're good to go, and this gives you code completion,

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,500
auto import, all the things you would expect from an ID.
