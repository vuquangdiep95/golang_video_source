00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,320
So let me give you a little bit of my own background in history.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:10,120
I've been working as an entrepreneur in the information technology sector since the early 1990s, and

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,870
I have done work for an awful lot of clients, including Thomson Reuters, a number of American and

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,900
Canadian banks, Hewlett Packard, General Motors and many others across North America, the Caribbean

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,190
and parts of Europe.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,670
And I've also been teaching at the university level for more than 30 years.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,330
And I do have a PhD in this field as well as a few others.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,500
And I really enjoy teaching.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,940
And one of the things that I like about Go is just how easy it is for people to pick this up and to

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,760
pick it up relatively quickly, even if they have no background in programming whatsoever.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,590
So I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about myself.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,410
I really want to get into the content of this course itself.

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,420
So let's get started.
