00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,850
So I thought I'd go over the goals for this exercise in a little more detail before you get started.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,580
So I'm on the overview page of our site and I'm talking about the pages behind these four boxes.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,070
So, for example, I have the healthy services and right now I have one healthy service and I want to

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,340
write code or I want you to write code such that when we receive the appropriate event, if this hosted

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,220
service HDP has changed from healthy to some other state, then it gets removed from this table and

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,300
gets added automatically to another table.

7
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:44,690
So if I happen to be looking at, for example, this table, I have no warning services right now.

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,090
Well, we don't have any warning services.

9
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,900
Let's go to the problem services instead.

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,470
I have no problem services right now.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,740
Now, let's assume I'm looking at this page and the service goes down.

12
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,940
Well, this page should get updated in real time.

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,260
So you're going to have to, first of all, push the property event and have a listener for that event

14
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,990
in your JavaScript binding to the public channel.

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,750
And if this service changes to a problem state, in my case, then you look at this table, which means

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,420
you have to have some means of addressing this table.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,820
You check to see if it has the no service row, if that's the only thing in there, you need to remove

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,680
that and then you add the appropriate role for the new problem service.

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,710
So that's the goal for this particular exercise.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,760
So you shouldn't have any trouble with it.

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,810
And if you do, don't worry.

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,480
In the next lecture, I'll show you what I've done and post the code with the appropriate solution to

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,080
the resources for that page.

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,110
So good luck.

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,960
Give it a try.

26
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,220
It's important that you actually try to do things on your own and don't just watch somebody else.

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,790
And I'm sure you won't have any problems at all.
