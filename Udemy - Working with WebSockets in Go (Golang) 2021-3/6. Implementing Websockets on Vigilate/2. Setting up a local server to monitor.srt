00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,410
So one of the things we need is a local server with a local service to monitor and I mean, I suppose

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,700
we could just try to monitor Google and hope that it goes down to see when things go wrong.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,670
But that might take a while.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,560
So instead, we've already entered a host on our application called Localhost, and it listens on port

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,870
eighty eighty for an HTTP service.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,560
So the simplest way to make this work is just to compile this very, very short program that listens

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,280
on Port 80 and returns Hello World.

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,340
And that's all that it does.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,580
So this is a very short program.

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:42,190
I've actually added to this full source code for this to the course resources for this page.

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:50,620
And once you have it, you can just run it by saying, you know, go run Dudko.

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,020
And that will listen on Port AT&amp;T.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,030
And that's what it does.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,590
It's now listening on Port AT&amp;T.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:06,520
So if I go to my favorite Web browser and try to go to HTP Collins localhost AT&amp;T, it actually returns

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,180
Hello World.

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,090
So we can start that and stop it as necessary to make sure that services are being monitored properly.

18
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,340
And we'll start doing that in the next lecture.
