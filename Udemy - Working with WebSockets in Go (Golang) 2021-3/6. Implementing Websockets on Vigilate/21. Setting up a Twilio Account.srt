1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,540
So just to make this as simple as possible, I'm going to create a new account on Twilio as well and

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,030
I'll use a different email here just so I can get a new account and you can follow along just in case

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,080
you're having difficulties.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,400
So I'll generate a password and I use one password to generate passwords.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:24,090
So I'll copy this one and paste it in here and I'll change it after this lecture because I think you

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,630
just saw it.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,310
But that's OK.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,950
I accept the terms and conditions.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,110
I'll start the free trial and I will save this as Twilio there.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,500
OK, so they sent me an email.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,360
I'll pause this, go verify everything and come back and continue.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,370
OK, so I went and clicked on verify email in the appropriate message that I received and it took me

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,380
to this screen.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,890
Now I've already got an off token aside, so I'm going to copy those.

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,390
I'll copy my new side and go back to my other screen here.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,240
Close this one and go back to Vigilante and go to settings and put in under my Twilio.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,970
I'll put my new aside, so I'll paste that in there.

18
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,970
Then I'll go back here and get my new off token.

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,530
Copy that, paste that in here and now I'll get a trial number.

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,230
So I'll get this trial number and I will copy this right like that.

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,930
And I'm just going to take the default one.

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,460
And again, you should pay attention if you're actually getting charged for text messages.

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,260
You may not want to do this, but I'm getting rid of the hyphen and everything, all the hyphens and

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,720
put on the parentheses and putting a plus sign in front of it.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,020
OK, so now I have that and under notifications now I actually want to receive them by text message

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,440
as well.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,280
And I'll simply put in my own cell phone number and I'll blurt out so I don't get any phone calls from

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,970
anybody else.

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,250
And save this.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
OK, so that's now saved.

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,040
So let's go back to the console councillor's.

32
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,550
I should have everything I need at this point to get started.

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,310
So I've got that set up in the next lecture will actually write the necessary code to send SMS messages.
