1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,420
So before we get started updating the message column on the various tables, I did overlook one thing

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,870
in the last lecture and I have right here on the screen in front of us, the same file in two different

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,400
windows.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,010
So on the right hand side is what we did last time where we built up an event model and then we inserted

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,120
it into the database.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,730
And that is in the test service for host function, which is exactly what it should be doing.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:34,140
But if we manually check a service, so if I'm back in my Web browser and I'm looking at localhost and

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,720
I look at it's one problem service that it has right now, if I clicked that check now button and the

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,890
status changes, it's not actually saving the event and I need to do that.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:51,180
And that, of course, is again in the perform dash checks go file under the method named test check.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,510
And all I have to do is after I test the host service and before I actually write the data right to

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,750
the database, the new status, I just have to put that same coded.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,620
And the only change necessary is to change this colon equals into an equal sign and that takes care

14
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,270
of that problem.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,120
And now the events table is updated, whether it's a regularly scheduled monitor check or it's one that

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,470
we've done manually by clicking that check now button.

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,610
OK, the next thing I want to do is back on the overview page.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
If I look at any of the screens behind these four boxes, like the Problems Service, for example,

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,940
I want something to show up in this message column because that really bothers me.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,020
And it's something that's been bothering me for a while and it's not difficult to fix.

21
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,960
But what it does require is a change to our database.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,590
So if I look at my database, I'm looking at the host services table.

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,540
Nowhere in here do I have a place to put the last message we got.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,220
I have a last check, so I'll just add a last underscore message, column of type string.

25
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,280
So let's go right on migration to do that.

26
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,910
So back in my ID, I will close this window, open my terminal, stop the application, clear the screen

27
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,200
and write a migration.

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:15,990
So to generate fiz, add last message to host services and I'll have that.

29
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:24,620
OK, now I'll open my browser on the left hand side, find the up migration and write that migration.

30
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:32,850
And that's just as simple as add underscore column open parentheses and then in quotes the name of the

31
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:41,040
table hosted services, then the name of the column which I'm going to call last underscore message,

32
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,210
then it's type which is string and then it's default.

33
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,610
And I am going to give this a default because I already have some entries in my host services table.

34
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,500
And if I don't give it a default or get an error, am I default will just be an empty string and I'll

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,410
close my curly brackets and close the parentheses.

36
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,340
And that's it for that one.

37
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:09,570
And the down migration is just drop underscore column, the table name hosted services and the column

38
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,050
name last message, and that's it for that one.

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,440
So now I should be able to run that migration.

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
So to migrate.

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,380
There it is.

42
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,660
And if you look at the table in the database right here, it's additive.

43
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,170
Perfect.

44
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,530
So we need to add that to our models.

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:36,240
So let me close these two migrations and go to our models file and find hosts service right here.

46
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,180
And I will add last message of type string to that.

47
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,840
OK, so since we made a change to our model and added a column in the database, we have to make some

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,900
changes in hosts or host underscore Posterous.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,730
So let's find where we have to do that.

50
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,940
So first of all, let's just search for to make it easy, I'll search for hosting services, OK?

51
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,890
Not there.

52
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,260
Here.

53
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,350
What's this one?

54
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,520
This is getting all hosts.

55
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,660
OK, we may as well get it in there.

56
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,710
It's not going to hurt or anything.

57
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:17,670
So we'll add at the very end of the query for the services last message.

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,570
And that's the last thing I'm selecting.

59
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:29,100
So I'll add it here at the end of this part where I'm scanning and we're scanning it into the last message.

60
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,820
Now, I'll search for host underscore services again.

61
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,170
And this is updating that's just updating the active status.

62
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,100
So that doesn't matter.

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,030
But the next one is update ho service.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,570
I definitely want to add it here.

65
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:51,090
So I'll put comma last message equals dollar sign nine, which changes this to dollar sign ten.

66
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,000
And that means I have to put my parameter right here.

67
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,980
Last message.

68
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,100
OK, and let's see if there's anywhere else.

69
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:11,350
Get service by status, and this is getting a service by status, services by status, and yet I have

70
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,240
to put it there as well.

71
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,250
So Staut last message, and that will be the last thing that I'm grabbing.

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,750
So that would be right here.

73
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,620
And H last message.

74
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,150
OK, let's check for one search for host underscore services again.

75
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,360
And this is get host service by IID.

76
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,620
I definitely need it there.

77
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,690
So I'll put my comma in and add H.

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,970
S dot last message and that's the last thing I'm selecting.

79
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,210
So it goes right here.

80
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:55,920
Last message and again, search for host underscore services and this is get services to monitor.

81
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,790
Do I need it there.

82
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,390
It's not going to hurt anything to do it.

83
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,600
And I'm returning the models of service.

84
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,760
So let's put it in their last message and that's the last thing I'm collecting.

85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,080
So I'll put it in right here.

86
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,260
Last message and again, search for host underscore services.

87
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,100
And this is getting hosted service by host service.

88
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,420
I'd definitely need it there.

89
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,470
So comma

90
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,300
dot, last message and it's the last thing I'm selecting.

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,690
So it goes at the last of this list or the end of this list.

92
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,090
Last message, one more check for host underscore services.

93
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,580
And we're going back to the top.

94
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,810
And we've already done everything from this point on, OK, so that updates are postgrads.

95
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,790
I had to pause here and insert this little snippet into the lecture because I inadvertently deleted

96
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,210
something I shouldn't have and I didn't want you to get confused.

97
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,270
So I'm looking at the healthy DOGIT file.

98
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,830
And now that we have our new model for host services, I need to add something in here.

99
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,610
And this is in the empty column where I want the message on display.

100
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,240
And all I have to put in here is dot last message.

101
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,600
Otherwise, when we go back and try to look at this page, we'll still be seeing an empty column even

102
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,420
though we have the necessary information in the database.

103
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,930
So I apologize for the intrusive nature of this little snippet, but I need to put it in or things won't

104
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,640
make sense near the end of this lecture.

105
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,140
Now, when do we populate that field?

106
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,180
Well, I think the most obvious place to do this is right here and perform checks.

107
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,960
We're already making a change to the host service record.

108
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,070
And it's right here.

109
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,560
And this is in the method called test check.

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,360
So we're doing that in a manual check.

111
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,490
Let's just find what else we're doing that where do we update the host service status in the database?

112
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,780
I'm just searching for update host service.

113
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:13,260
So that's a status count we're passing at a hosted service right here.

114
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,140
Yeah, so this gets called update host service status count gets called on schedule check.

115
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:27,140
And right here, we're already changing the status and we can actually just actually pass that another

116
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,800
argument.

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,840
So we have here the new status.

118
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,640
We have the host service.

119
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,340
We can we're actually passing it the message already.

120
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,050
So this is the perfect spot to do it.

121
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:46,070
If we can just say last message equals message and that should do it for automated checks.

122
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,260
So let's try this.

123
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,270
Let's stop our application.

124
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,830
Start our application, go back and look and see what our status is look like right now, so we have

125
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:11,570
one problem service and let's go back and start our Web server and go back and watch this.

126
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,480
And the problem service should go away.

127
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,690
There it is.

128
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,470
And let's look under healthy services and we have our message posted there.

129
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,340
Perfect.

130
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,050
So that's for automated checks.

131
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,540
The only other place to do this is and I'm going to switch back to my correct window.

132
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,970
The only other place to do this is on the manual, which is called Test Check right here.

133
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,310
So here we broadcast the service and we did exactly the same thing right here.

134
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,100
We already have our message.

135
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,410
So we just put in here a dot.

136
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:57,290
Last message equals MSJ, and that should take care of it for that.

137
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,590
So the only other change is to go back to healthy jet, find this last message and I'll copy that.

138
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,290
And now we open the other three windows.

139
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:16,020
So problems we can just paste that right in here and warning, which is right here and the last one

140
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,870
is pending right here.

141
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,820
And that should take care of it.

142
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,940
OK, so now we have those fields in or those columns in the tables populated with data, and I feel

143
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,690
better about that.

144
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,440
All right.

145
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,240
We'll move on in the next lecture.
