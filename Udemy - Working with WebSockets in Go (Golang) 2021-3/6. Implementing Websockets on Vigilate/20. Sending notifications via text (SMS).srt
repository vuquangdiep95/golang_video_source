1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,080
So the last bit of key functionality we need to add to our project in terms of notifications is sending

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,120
notifications via SMS or text message, and we'll do that using Twilio.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,670
And what we'll do is create a developer account, a trial account that gives us a certain balance to

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,870
use for testing.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,430
And provided you do this in the next month or two, you should have no problem doing this and having

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,410
it cost you nothing.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,990
So go to this Eurail Twilio dot com and I've put a link to that in the course resources sign up and

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,330
you'll get a trial account.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,070
And once you've done that, you'll get to the console page and the console page looks just like this

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,900
and you're going to have an account.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,970
Essid and an off token.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,960
This is public.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,790
Doesn't matter if anybody else sees this.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,950
This is private.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,830
So I'm not going to show that to you, even though I'm going to change it after this lecture is done.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,580
I can copy it just by copying it right here.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,520
So in my application, before we do anything else, let's set this up.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:02,030
So I've gone to the Settings page and clicked on the SMS tab over here and I will say, yes, enable

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,050
text notifications and I'm going to choose the one provider that I'm doing in this course.

20
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,560
There are other providers and they all follow a very similar format.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,330
So I'll choose Twilio and I'll put in my Twilio phone number, which I'll get in a minute.

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,920
But let's get our key first.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,580
So I'll go back to here and I'll choose this.

24
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,200
Copy my essid.

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,480
And paste it in here and go to my here and copy the off Tolkan.

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,180
And pasted in here.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,010
Now, in order to make this as simple as possible, I've also posted a link to the a blog post put up

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,840
by Twilio that talks about using gold and sending SMS messages, and you'll find that right here.

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,510
So, again, this URL is copied and pasted into the course resources for this lecture.

30
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,010
And what you want to do is scroll down to the part that says, I don't know why they're there.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,270
Formatting is off and some of the text is behind images, but it doesn't really matter for our purposes.

32
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,810
So this is the part you want to look at.

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:11,730
Say hello to Twilio and that will take you through all of the steps necessary to to get a trial account

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,450
up and going.

35
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,120
And at the time that I'm recording this, at least you get fifteen dollars and fifty cents in test balance

36
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,210
so you can test things out.

37
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,490
So follow these instructions and get it all set up.

38
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,010
And you'll also see the part where it asks you to get a phone number and get that phone number and paste

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,500
it in here and I'll go get mine and paste it in here and then we'll pick it up in the next lecture and

40
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,080
actually start sending test SMS messages.
