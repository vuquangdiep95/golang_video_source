00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:08,050
So starting a mail hog on windows is actually really, really easy, you just download it from the site,

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,180
as I showed you with the last lecture, and you drag it to your desktop or put it wherever you want

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,080
and double click on it.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,680
And once it's double clicked, it will actually start up.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,780
So I can go to my favorite Web browser.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,670
And connect to localhost a25.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,980
And there's mail hug, so just make sure you have it running when you're trying to test the email functionality

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,200
from your application and you'll be good.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,970
Now, if it's not running, you'll get an error.

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,440
So just go start it up and try again and you'll be fine and to quit out of it.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,510
It's pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,510
Just close this window and that's all there is to it.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,550
It couldn't be simpler.
