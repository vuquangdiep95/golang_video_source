00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,080
So we need to install a local mail server and it is a testing mail server, and while you could actually

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,450
populate the necessary configurations right in your server configuration, when you're sending mail

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,870
and send it through a live server in development, that's never a good idea and it's never a good idea

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,510
because occasionally at some point you will be working with data that includes actual email addresses

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,030
and you'll be sending emails left, right and center without realizing you're actually sending to real

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,450
people.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,150
So the way we get around that is by installing a local mail server and using that instead.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,300
Or you could use mail trapped or one of the commercial services.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,000
But I find mail hug are really easy to use package.

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,760
And if you're on a Mac, then this lecture will show you how to install it on a Macintosh.

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,310
If you're on Windows, then it's a little different.

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,620
So I'll have a separate lecture for that because I need to be in front of a Windows machine to do it.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,980
But first of all, go here, go to my blog and when you scroll down, it'll tell you how to install

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,130
it.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,450
And on Mac it says Use Broo update and install Malha.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,970
Now, you can't do that unless you happen to have homebrew already installed if you don't go install

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,110
it.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,210
It's a really simple process and it's incredibly useful.

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,850
Homebrew has thousands and thousands of packages which are of immense use to developers.

20
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,990
For example, we could have set up postgrads using homebrew on a Mac or on a Mac and it would be just

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,900
as just as functional as the one that I had you install.

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,760
Actually, I'm using postgrads installed through Homebrew anyway to install it.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,330
Copy this command as it appears here.

24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,090
So just copy it or click the copy button.

25
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,900
Not even easier.

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,570
Go to your favorite terminal, open a new window and paste it in and then run it.

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,750
Now I already have it installed so I'm not going to install it, but this will actually install it for

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,270
you and it will take a little while.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:01,110
So once that's done, you just use the commands right on this page back here, copy and paste this.

30
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,330
And when you do that, once it's installed mail hug, you will be able to run it by using the command

31
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:14,610
line or more more usefully, you can actually use this command Broo Services start mail hook and that

32
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,360
will start it for you.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,130
I have it stopped right now, running right now.

34
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,880
So I'll stop it.

35
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,620
I'll stop the service

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,290
bus services, stop mail hug.

37
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:34,360
And brew services start mail hug, I guess they didn't have it running and we'll start it.

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,690
So now it's running.

39
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,260
So now that it's running, I can go to my favorite browser and type in HTTP called English Localhost

40
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,050
Colen eight 025.

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,060
So it's running on a port eight 025 and there is mail hug up and running.

42
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,350
So install that.

43
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,270
And in the next lecture I'll show Windows people how to install it on your Windows machine.
