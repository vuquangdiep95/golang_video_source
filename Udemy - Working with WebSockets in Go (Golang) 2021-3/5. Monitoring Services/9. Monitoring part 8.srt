1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,530
OK, so we're at the point right now where we think if I look at my code, we have the monitoring being

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,530
turned off properly and that's actually true.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,890
But we do have a problem that we that you may have noticed.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,260
But I didn't notice it until after the last lecture and before this one.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,480
So my application is running right now and monitoring appears to be turned off.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,890
So let's turn monitoring on.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,440
OK, and now let's go to another page.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,260
And now let's turn monitoring off, OK, and let's go back to another page, so monitoring is off.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,690
And when I go back to the overview page, it appears to be on and there's a reason for that because

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,370
when we toggle that switch.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,720
So let's go back to our code here.

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:50,840
When we toggle that switch right in this JavaScript, OK, I'm calling set system, which is perfect.

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,110
And if we look at our roots file and we find that set system pref right here and I go to that.

14
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,840
So when I do this, I'm updating the system preference.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,340
But what I'm not doing just before the point where I, I actually send back to Jason is I'm never updating

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,260
that value in our preference map that's being handed to all of our pages.

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,280
So I need to do that.

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,450
So I need to say something as simple as.

19
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,410
Repo dot app, dot preference map, and I'm looking for monitoring.

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,900
Monitoring Desh Live, I think it's called La Dash, let's make sure go to our preferences now it's

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:42,610
underscore life monitoring, underscore Leive that needs to be set to the actual value that we're passing

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,110
to our update system.

23
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,430
And that's value.

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,090
OK, so that we'll update it in our application wide config, so let's make sure that actually works

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,110
before we go any further.

26
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,540
OK, I'll stop my application and start it.

27
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:03,080
So it starts up reload the page to see what it actually looks like and it says the monitoring is turned

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,490
off.

29
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,400
And if I go to my database and reload, that monitoring is turned off.

30
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,060
Perfect.

31
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,590
Now let's turn it on, OK?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,370
And let's reload the database to make sure it's turned on.

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:13,910
It is.

34
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,220
Let's go to another page.

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,420
Still on.

36
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,090
Let's turn it off, OK, and go back to our overview page, and it's still off.

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,620
So that takes care of that problem.

38
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,770
And that was an oversight I should have noticed long before now.

39
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,900
But we run into these things now and again.

40
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,220
OK, so let's go back to our code and look at our handlers.

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,380
And this is the part we want to do turning monitoring on.

42
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,900
So as I said before, we actually can't do it the way that it's set up right now because we have no

43
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,260
access to the code and start monitoring ago in our main package.

44
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,400
So what I'm going to do is copy all of this code except for the package statement.

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,430
Copy it and then I'll comment it out because I don't need it and I'll delete this file before too long.

46
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:09,770
And then back in my handlers package, I'll create a new go file called Start Dash Monitoring Dutko

47
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,000
and I will add that to my repository and I'll just paste this code in and then I'll need to clean a

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,580
few things up.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,420
So to start with, we don't have access to the preference map here like we do in the main package,

50
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,650
but we still have access to it.

51
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,840
We just have to say app dot preference map and that fixes that problem.

52
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,250
And then if you go down here, we have lots of other things to look at.

53
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:39,230
So services to monitor is not equal to repo DB services to monitor unless we give this the receiver,

54
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,800
which is repo DB repo.

55
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,620
OK, so that should fix all of the problems down here, and it appears to the last problem we have is

56
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,600
that I can't call repo scheduled check because I don't have access to the repo variable here.

57
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,540
Actually, I do have access to the repo variable here because if you look at our.

58
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:11,170
Handler's file over here, handlers don't go at the very top, and this was in the default code that

59
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,740
you cloned when you started this course or this section of the course when I called new handlers, I'm

60
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:23,120
setting a package level variable called repo with the capital are equal to my database repo.

61
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,640
So back here in handlers start monitoring, all I have to do is change this to an upper kasar and that

62
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,760
will take care of it.

63
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,170
So now this actually works the way that it's supposed to.

64
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:43,570
So back in my handlers at the very bottom, when I'm turning monitoring on right here, all I have to

65
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,870
do is call start handlers.

66
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,220
So start hand or start monitoring.

67
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,260
I can call it by saying repo dots, start monitoring and that should take care of it.

68
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,310
So the last thing we need to do is to change our start up of our application, which is in setup Apgar.

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,830
So we can't call start monitoring anymore because that's that's just been commented out and I'm about

70
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,000
to delete that file.

71
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:15,640
But what we can do is call go handlers, dot start monitoring, which means I need to go rename start

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,310
monitoring to make it visible outside of the package.

73
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,120
No problem.

74
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,740
Let's do that.

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,040
So that's in handlers and now it's in start monitoring here.

76
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,780
Let's just rename this to make it visible outside of this package.

77
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:42,640
Start monitoring and we'll have to change it in our handlers to get that a capital S and our setup up.

78
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,380
Handlers, repo, don't start monitoring, and I put it go in front of it, just sort of run in the

79
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,580
background and the application will start a little faster.

80
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,630
So in theory, this should all work.

81
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,850
Now, I'll make sure that I have the code in the old start monitoring comment that out and I do.

82
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,150
And that means if this works, I can delete this file.

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,960
So let's stop our application.

84
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,550
Start our application.

85
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,310
And all compiled perfect, so that means I can stop this.

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,110
And simply delete from command web, the start monitoring go file.

87
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,470
And one last thing in set up aiport go, this is just a cleanup.

88
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,750
I actually don't need to start the schedule here at all because it's going to be handled by start monitoring

89
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,040
so I can delete this line entirely and I might as well do that and we should be good.

90
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,390
So now we have a means of actually turning the scheduler on and off.

91
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,880
And we're now at the point where we can actually start pushing events from our application to all the

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,190
connected clients and doing something with it.

93
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,460
And we'll get started on that in the next section.
