1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,820
So before we can actually make sure that we're pushing events to our clients and receiving them properly,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,550
it will be really helpful if I could actually have this work, because then I can start my application

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,670
and have it display as on, because we've manually set it to on in the database already.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,970
And then when you talk, it actually turns the monitoring off and then we can turn it back on and wait

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,310
for the events to be pushed to us.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,360
So let's get started doing that.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,300
And I'm going to go over to my I.D. and I'm going to open LAYO jet, which is in The View's folder,

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,100
in the layout layouts folder.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,420
And it's called Layout Yet.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,210
And right here, where is that?

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,590
Tarballs right here in front of me.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,180
OK, so in this div where I have my class form, check form switch and the label is monitoring this,

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,240
these lines right here correspond to this button.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,650
So I'm going to put an if statement in here if and I have available to me on every template, my preference

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:06,780
map and I pass that using my render function functionality when I pass a bunch of data to every template

16
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:18,680
and I'm going to look for in my preference map if the value of money touring live is equal to one.

17
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,650
And remember that everything stored in the preference map is a string, then I'm going to do something

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,210
otherwise else and then I'll have my end and I'll just copy this.

19
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,000
I tab it over first.

20
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,090
Tablet over, copy and paste it right here, and I guess I've got a tablet, too.

21
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,550
OK, so my ID is telling me that I have two things with the same ID and that doesn't matter because

22
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,470
only one of them will show up at a given time.

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,170
So if it's turned on, then I want this to be checked.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,930
So I will say checked on the input and if I save that, so then my application is already running and

25
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,040
reload this page it should show has checked and it does.

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,430
OK, so now I want this toggle to actually call some JavaScript and it already has an ID and I'm calling

27
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,040
it monitoring dash life.

28
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,020
So in my JavaScript.

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,240
I'll just add another event listener, so I'll put it right in here, my dumb content loaded, I'll

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:31,730
just make sure that there's actually going to be here, I'll say document get element by ID.

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,360
And I called it monitoring Leive.

32
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:44,440
And I wanted to add an event listener, and the event I'm looking for is change, and I'm just going

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,680
to call a function and inside of that function.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,460
Well, right now, let's just make sure it's actually going to work.

35
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,050
We'll say console dialogue changed toggle it'll work.

36
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,760
I like to verify these things just to make sure that I can trap any typographical errors early on.

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,850
OK, so now when I toggle this, I should get a message and I do.

38
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,270
OK, so that's working properly.

39
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,240
What do I actually want to do in here?

40
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,820
I don't want to just toggle right to the console.

41
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:20,700
I actually want to make sure that I do something based upon the state of that check.

42
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,570
So let's find out what the state of that check is, whether it's turned on or off.

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,760
So I will say let enabled.

44
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,260
In other words, monitoring is enabled equal to document.

45
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:42,860
Get element by ID, and again, I'm going to get it from monitoring, live monitor, touring, live

46
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:44,870
checked.

47
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,290
So that will be true if the doc if that Torvill is turned on.

48
00:03:50,840 --> 00:04:00,590
So I'll say if it's not enabled, in other words, if it's turned off, do something, otherwise do

49
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,200
something else.

50
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,180
So if it's not enabled, what do I actually want it to do?

51
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,580
First of all, I want to get a confirmation.

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,570
I want to make sure that the user knows that he or she is turning monitoring off.

53
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,520
So someone make take advantage of that attention module that we used a little while ago.

54
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:22,450
And I'll call the method confirm and I'll pass it some parameters, so I'll put in some HTML.

55
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,230
This will be what's being displayed and say this will stop monitoring.

56
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,730
Of all hosts and services, are you sure?

57
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,100
So that'll be the what's the message is displayed and I'm going to give it a callback.

58
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,940
And the callback is nothing more than a function that gets the result of whatever action the user chooses.

59
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,890
So function result and I'll say if result.

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,440
In other words, if the result is actually true, then I'll just write a comment here.

61
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,190
Want to turn?

62
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,580
Try that again.

63
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,610
Want to turn.

64
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:21,440
Monitoring off and I right to the console console, that log would turn monitoring off.

65
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,350
OK, so that's if the result is true.

66
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:35,280
If it's false, else then we'll just say document dot, get out of it by ID.

67
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,180
And again, it's monitoring live.

68
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,180
And Will said it's checked to.

69
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,510
True.

70
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,420
So basically we'll give them a confirmation dialog box.

71
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,750
If they say yeah, turn it off then we'll actually turn it off.

72
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,330
Otherwise we'll set it back to turned on the toggle and take no other action that's purely cosmetic.

73
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,060
So let's go back here, reload.

74
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,430
This monitoring is now turned on.

75
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,460
This should give me a confirmation.

76
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,990
This will stop monitoring of all hosts and services.

77
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,650
Are you sure?

78
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,530
If I say cancel, it should turn this toggle back on.

79
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,390
And it does, but if I say, OK, it should leave, it turned off and I should get something in the

80
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,530
console log.

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,310
Would turn monitoring off, OK, so that seems to be working.

82
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:26,250
All right, so how are we going to actually toggle the monitoring on and off?

83
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,320
Well, the first thing we want to do logically is we want to in the database.

84
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,700
And let's look at the database again.

85
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,400
We're looking at the preferences table.

86
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,370
I want to change this to a zero.

87
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,100
So I'm going to have to write some code that updates a preference.

88
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,160
So rather than writing one specifically for monitoring alive, maybe I'll write a more generic one in

89
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,690
case I ever want to change the already more generic function that allows me to change the preferences

90
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,670
to whatever value I want them to be.

91
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,520
And the second thing I want to do is I actually want to stop monitoring.

92
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,570
So I need to stop the the current jobs that are running in the background.

93
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,590
They're not really cron jobs, but it's the Go Chron package and that's how I think of them.

94
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,180
So we want to do that.

95
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,890
And that's all we really need to do in this case.

96
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,760
So we'll get started on that.

97
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,500
In the next lecture, we'll write the necessary database function and we'll also figure out how to start

98
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,310
and stop our monitoring process in the background.
