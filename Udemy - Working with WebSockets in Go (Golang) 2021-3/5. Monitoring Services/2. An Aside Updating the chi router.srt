1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,230
I just have a little aside here, as I was recording this course, the rudder were using GOCE.

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:13,540
If you go to that website or go to the GitHub repository and scroll down, you will see that we now

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,880
have semantic versioning.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,410
So he's actually changed the way that we import this, which means that we probably should update our

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,860
dependency to use the new version.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,540
So I'm going to copy the entire install thing here.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,080
And not the only change from the last time we did this was slash V5 has been added to the install you

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:39,160
URL and I'll go back to my ID and I should caution you that my ID is going to try to be helpful and

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,240
it will make updating this just a little tricky, but not too bad.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,790
So I'm going to go get that dependency and it adds it and then I'll go to everywhere that I'm using

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,610
this and I'm using it for sure in my file.

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:01:00,460
And all I really need to do is to come up here and change this, to slash V5 and hopefully it won't

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,160
do what it often does and try to import things for me.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,990
OK, so it seemed to work that time.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,480
Now let's find out where else we're using this.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,790
I'm going to begin a search in here by saying find in files and I'm looking at my command web folder

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,700
and I'll look for cheap and it finds it only in my rootstock go.

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,150
Perfect.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,450
OK, so now I know it's also being used in my handlers to get parameters, so I'll find in files, cheat

20
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,490
and I'll open this in the find window.

21
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,540
And the first place that's using it is my handlers don't go.

22
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,640
So let me go to that and scroll to the top and change the import to the five.

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,850
OK, that worked.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,220
Where else do we have it?

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,010
So we had in our handler stock, we also have it and perform checks Dargo So let's open that up and

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,360
scroll to the top and change that to V5.

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,280
And if there are no errors and there are not, then that should work.

28
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:04,930
So the only other change here, if I look at my go mod file, I actually have two versions of CZI installed

29
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,120
right here and I don't need both of those now.

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,380
I could manually delete this, but the proper way to do it, of course, is to just make sure you're

31
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,980
in the level of your project and type go mod tidy.

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,730
And that should and it did it got rid of the old one, and that's all there is to it.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,630
So now we've updated our dependency to use the correct new version that supports semantic versioning.

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,730
And that's just a little aside.

35
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,620
And I like to keep things up to date whenever possible, so I'll commit and push this to my repository.

36
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,280
And let's move on.
