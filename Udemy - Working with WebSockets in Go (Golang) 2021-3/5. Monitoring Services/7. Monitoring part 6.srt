1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,410
So now we want to actually update the system preference, any system preference, and this is going

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,590
to be a lot easier than I thought because apparently we already wrote this function, this database

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,000
function, set system pref, which does exactly what we want.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,130
It'll delete it if it exists and then insert it if it doesn't.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,430
Now we can write an update function, but this isn't going to change a great deal.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:29,200
And I don't think we'll hit the billions of the the IDE limit of some billion records.

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,880
So I think we're OK so we can go back to our handlers.

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,510
And here, just after we declare and set default values for this message, we can say error is assigned

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,500
the value of.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,940
Repo debe set system prev and the parents name is a name which will have to get in the second and the

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,540
preference value is value.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,780
So let's grab those values from here so we can just say pref name is assign the value of our dot, our

13
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,780
post form dot yet.

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,130
And what we want is what do we call that in our JavaScript and make sure we get that right.

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,630
So update system pref name and value.

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,810
Underscore CREF name.

17
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,030
And prep value

18
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:28,730
is a sign the value of our post from target prep value, if there's an error, if error is not equal

19
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:39,560
to nil, then respawn OK equals false and respect message is equal to error.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,670
I think a error on error that will get it for us.

21
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,060
OK, so that should take care of it.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,650
So let's give this a try.

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,010
So I'll start my application and start my application.

24
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,360
And we'll go to the database and look and see what it's set to right now, so monitoring live is currently

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,960
set to one.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,770
And if I go back to my Web browser and reload this.

27
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,290
And turn it off and say, yes, I want it off.

28
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,680
I got a two hundred, OK, which set back, sent back OK is true with no message.

29
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,370
And if I go to the database.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,090
The preferences now set to three No.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,430
There it is, monitoring lives down here, so desirable because it has a higher I.D., it appears lower

32
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,030
on the screen.

33
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,210
So that should take care of it for us.

34
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:36,110
Now, if you really don't like that incremented ID, it's not that difficult to do fix that.

35
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,750
We can actually go back to our preferences.

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,820
And I'm going to do that because this irritates me right now.

37
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:50,030
I can actually copy this entire function pasted here and just call this update system pref.

38
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,970
Which is actually nicer, so we can just get rid of this and say query is assigned, so we'll just fix

39
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,220
this query and it's pretty straightforward.

40
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,380
We just say update preferences set.

41
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,320
And what's the name of the column preference equal to dollar sign one.

42
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,570
And then we'll do the updated as well.

43
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,170
Updated and equal to or something to where.

44
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:27,340
And the name column is called name name equals Dollar Sign three and we'll pass in the update.

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:35,520
Preferences set preference equal to and that will be the value updated at equal to time Don.

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,010
Now.

47
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:45,420
And the last one is where the name is equal to name, and I should do it for us now if I copy this signature.

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:54,040
And go to my repository and add that into, say, preferences up here.

49
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,490
We could use that one as well, but this is just may as well put it in there, it's not going to hurt

50
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,870
anything.

51
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,380
Go back to preferences and make sure this is all correct.

52
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,220
It is.

53
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,180
And go to our handlers and change this to update system, pref, pref name, press value.

54
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,450
And what I'm calling is name and value.

55
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,280
So that should work.

56
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,610
OK, so let's go back to her handlers.

57
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,720
Make sure that's correct.

58
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,640
Will stop our application.

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,840
Start our application.

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,480
And go reload the browser page, look at the database.

61
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,950
So right now, Monitoring Live has the idea of five and that should go to one and it is five when I

62
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,490
do this.

63
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,270
So let's try that.

64
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,310
I think this is cleaner.

65
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,380
I'll turn it back on.

66
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,210
Come here.

67
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,680
Reload the database.

68
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,620
And it did stay to ninety five and it got a preference of one.

69
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,470
So that's exactly what I wanted.

70
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,870
Now there may be some cleanup required at the end because I'm not entirely sure we need all of these

71
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,740
database methods.

72
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,520
But for our purposes, we just want to get to the point where we can play with WebSocket a little bit

73
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:02,810
more.

74
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,640
So I'm satisfied with this for the moment.

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,960
All right.

76
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,590
The next step is to actually go and turn our monitoring schedule on and off, and we'll take care of

77
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,150
that in the next lecture or two.
