1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,840
So in this section of the course, what we're going to build is a very simple chat application built

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,940
using go is the back end and WebSocket to to actually send the messages back and forth.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,440
So on the left hand side of the screen, you can see there is no user currently logged in.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,810
And there's one person online, Bernie and Bernie is over here on the right hand side.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,470
But if Fred joins you, notice how it automatically populated Fred down here and it pushed it over here.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,910
And that's done using Web sockets.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,890
And the Web sockets package we're going to use is guerrilla web sockets.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,640
And it's a very easy one to use.

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,600
So this is a very simple way to get our feet wet with WebSocket.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,600
Now, this is not a fully functional Web application.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,240
There is, for example, no database behind the users and so forth, and there's no login page, and

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,730
that's OK.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,970
The second project, what we're doing in this course is a fully functional Web application with all

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,310
the nuts and bolts and all the pieces we need to to actually do something a little more sophisticated

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,320
than a simple chat.

16
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,130
But this is a perfect way of getting our feet wet.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,260
So if I send a message from Fred to Bernie, hello, Bernie.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,390
It appears and if I change the name here from Fred to Frederick, it changes it down here and it instantly

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,320
pushes it over here.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,010
And this shows you just how fast and interactive you can make your Web applications by using Web sockets.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,060
So let's get started.
