1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,740
Before we get to sending messages, there's one other case I want to handle, and you may have noticed

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,290
that already.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,690
So I've just started the server and as you can see in the log file, only one client is connected because

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,220
I started here and there's the connected message and I'll register as Fred as I have been right along.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,420
Now I'm going to go to another browser and open a new window and go to localhost AT&amp;T.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,220
And because the only thing I do when you first come to the page is connect to the server.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,440
I don't get the news online.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,400
That action has never been sent to me from the server to handle in JavaScript.

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,310
But if I go back to Fred, you'll see if I, for example, change my name or I send a message, I do

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,850
something that actually contacts the server.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,240
It sends back an empty string for a user, someone who's hit the page but has not yet entered their

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,750
username.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,150
And I probably don't want to do that.

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,530
I probably don't want to have that person show up or I want to have them show up as a lurker or something

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:57,950
like that.

16
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,270
So we should probably fix that.

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,230
And that's pretty easy.

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,340
All I have to do is go back to my code, find my handlers, go down to the part where I get the user

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,350
list and all I have to do is run a check in here.

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,220
If X is not equal to nothing, then append it, otherwise skip it.

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,930
And that should take care of that situation.

22
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:27,520
So let's make sure let's stop this started again and I'll go back to my Fred page and just hit that.

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,340
So now I should be connected and there's nothing there and I'll go back to my other page and hit that.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,290
So now I have two clients connected, but no names in there.

25
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,970
And if I go back to Fred and put Fred in here, I just get Fred.

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,790
But if I go to this one and put in Bernie, I get Fred and Bernie and I get Fred and Bernie.

27
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,250
So that handles that one situation.

28
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,310
OK, now we'll finally get around to sending messages.
