1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,200
Let's just take a few minutes to clean things up, because we have a little bit of messy JavaScript

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,300
code on our home page, so I'm going to go to the bottom here and see what I might do to clean things

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:10,510
up.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,470
So you notice here I defined a user field on a message field variable to point to the elements username

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,280
and message.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:25,920
But I think down here somewhere I have let's see, get element by ID.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,410
There it is.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,220
This one.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,490
Well, instead of having user input here, I've already defined a reference to it up above.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,660
So let's just say get rid of that and call it user field.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,020
So that one's OK.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,300
And the same thing here.

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,640
I don't need to do document get a little bit of B element body message.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,060
I already have a message field so that's good.

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,940
And look here I have send message taking place here and then I have it taking place again here.

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,990
You probably noticed that.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,920
Let's get rid of that.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,650
And if I have any other ones there, send button username and message, that's fine.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,240
Except here I don't need to do that.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:12,460
I can just say user field and here I can say message field.

21
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,310
No sense in doing look, ups, if I've already got a reference to it, and that should be fine here,

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,240
except I can say message field.

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,260
All right, let's save that and stop our application and start our application and make sure everything

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,300
still works the way we expect it to.

25
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,980
And then we'll make a couple of other improvements.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,720
So I'll reload this page by hitting return their log on as NENO works.

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,260
This is from Dino.

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,030
Send the message.

29
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,940
Good second message this time I'll press return to send it.

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,090
That worked well.

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:04,460
And back over here if I connect again and go on as Fred Weir is Dino and that should show up here and

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:04,970
it does.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,350
OK, so that's a little cleaner.

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,990
Now there's a few other things I'd like to take care of.

35
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,600
One is I don't like this alert.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,890
It really irritates me.

37
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,450
It just doesn't look good to me.

38
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,970
So instead, I want to use this package which I've used in other courses and I use all the time in production,

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,690
and it's called Nottie and it gives really nice alerts at the top of the page.

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,030
So let's get a copy of that from CD and Jazz and I'll look for Nottie.

41
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,590
And there it is.

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,940
So click on it and we will get the note he minge, yes, that's what I want.

43
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:52,630
So copy script tag, and I'll go put that script right at the beginning of my JavaScript here and format

44
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,560
a little better and I need to get also the success Nottie Minsk's.

45
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,960
Let's copy that link tag and put that at the top of our page in the head right about here.

46
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,710
And format that, OK, so now I have Nottie and let's see how it works, let's go back and look at the

47
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,420
documentation.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,350
How do I actually use this?

49
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,290
Simplest of cases is right here.

50
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,910
So let's copy that one and we'll just make an alert down here.

51
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,960
We'll just create a new function

52
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,680
function error and it'll take a string, which I'll call MSJ.

53
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,730
And inside of that will do it.

54
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,850
No, the alert and we want a type is going to be an error.

55
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,100
So let's get rid of all this and put in error.

56
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,280
Text will be the message and everything else I can leave alone.

57
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,300
I'll just take the defaults for that.

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,940
So now we have an error message.

59
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,410
I'll call it error message.

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,900
OK, so we'll copy that.

61
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,490
And everywhere I have an alert.

62
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,130
Let's just go to the top and search for alert.

63
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,820
OK, now instead I'll say.

64
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,310
Error message, filla username.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,920
And message.

66
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,560
OK, and look for the next alert.

67
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:43,540
We'll change that to their message, capitalize that and put a name at the end and an exclamation point,

68
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,100
why not?

69
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,690
And that's not the alert, OK, so that should actually be a little bit better.

70
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,380
Let's go back here, try reloading this page by hitting written up here and just try sending a message,

71
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,430
fill out username, a message that's much better, OK?

72
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,800
And it goes away less intrusive than the error alert that we saw before.

73
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,020
OK, so that was just a little clean up.

74
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:13,030
And the last couple of things I want to do for this chat project is we've never trap for a situation

75
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,500
where the server goes away and if the server goes away, maybe it's been rebooted.

76
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,920
Maybe you just lost an Internet connection for a few minutes or a few seconds.

77
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,530
But really, we have no way of indicating to the user that something has gone awry.

78
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,570
And we want to, first of all, let them know that they've lost their connection to the server.

79
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,630
And secondly, we want to reconnect as automatically and give them some indication that they've reconnected.

80
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,270
And we'll take care of that in the next lecture.
